		The Eclipse Platform's help system defines two extension points
		("toc" and "contexts") that allow individual plug-ins to
		contribute online help and context-sensitive help for their
		components. In this article we will investigate the "toc"
		extension point and how you can use it to contribute
		documentation for your plug-in.
