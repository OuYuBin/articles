<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Online help can be added to an Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP) application with a modest amount of 
effort by adding the plug-ins that comprise the Eclipse help system. The first 
section of this article discusses the benefits of integrating the help system 
into your application. This is followed by a tutorial which describes in detail 
the steps required to add help system support to a newly created RCP application 
while avoiding commonly encountered pitfalls. Finally we describe how to 
add context help and how to fine tune the settings of your help system.</p>

<h2>Why include the Eclipse Help System in your Application?</h2>

<p>Very few applications are self explanatory to the point where they require no 
documentation. For an RCP application the easiest way to add that documentation 
support is to use the Eclipse help system. The Eclipse help system is supported 
on all of the same platforms as Eclipse and has developed over years into a 
robust, feature rich and extensible component, which continues to grow in terms 
of both quality and features.</p>

<p>The Eclipse help system uses a browser-based presentation and therefore has 
full support for HTML. Search is automatically included in the help system; 
context help and keyword index are supported if you provide the appropriate 
content files. If you want to allow the same help pages that you provide in 
your application to be accessed from the Internet you can host them on 
an InfoCenter: a web server which serves help pages. Localization is 
supported so that you can provide documentation in additional languages.</p>

<p>The help system (since 3.3) has extension points for content producers that 
programmatically generate help content including a table of 
contents, keyword index, and content pages. This can be useful when converting 
documentation from some other format into HTML.</p>

<h2>Tutorial </h2>

<p>The next sections walk through the process of adding help support to a newly 
created RCP application. You may already have an RCP application but we 
recommend that you create a new application for this exercise. That way you can 
experiment on a sample before modifying your application. </p>

<h3>Create a Rich Client Application</h3>

<p>The Plug-in Development Environment (PDE) has some templates for
creating RCP applications. For this article we will use the Mail Template as it already has some
menus in place.</p>

<p>From the workbench select the menu item &quot;<strong>File &gt; New &gt; Project...</strong>&quot; and select the
&quot;<strong>Plug-in Project</strong>&quot; template.</p>

<p>Enter &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.helprcp</strong>&quot; in the &quot;<strong>Project name</strong>&quot; field and hit &quot;<strong>Next</strong>&quot;.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img border="0" src="images/pde_wizard1.png" width="500" height="500" >
</div>

<p>On the second screen be sure to select the &quot;<strong>Yes</strong>&quot; option
in the
&quot;<strong>Rich Client Application</strong>&quot; section.</p>

<div class="figure"><img border="0" src="images/pde_wizard2.png" width="500" height="500"></div>

<p>And on the final screen select the &quot;<strong>RCP Mail Template</strong>&quot;.</p>

<div class="figure"><img border="0" src="images/pde_wizard3.png" width="500" height="500"></div>

<p>Hit &quot;<strong>Finish</strong>&quot; and your project will be created. You can test your
application by opening the &quot;<strong>Plug-in Manifest Editor</strong>&quot; and, in the &quot;<strong>Overview</strong>&quot; tab,
clicking on &quot;<strong>Launch an Eclipse Application</strong>&quot;. You will see an application start
which already has a &quot;<strong>Help</strong>&quot; menu with an &quot;<strong>About RCP Product</strong>&quot; submenu. Click on the &quot;<strong>About RCP Product</strong>&quot;
submenu and this is what you will see.</p>

<p class = "figure"><img border="0" src="images/rcp1.png" width="600" height="400"></p>

<h3>Create a Product Configuration</h3>

<div class="note"><p><img border="0" src="images/tip.gif" width="62" height="13"> Adding the help
system is easiest if you have a plug-in based product configuration. </p></div>

<p>To create the product configuration, perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Switch to the <strong>Plug-in Development</strong> perspective if you are not already there
  (Use the <strong>Window &gt; Open Perspective</strong> menu option).</li>
  <li>Select &quot;<strong>File &gt; New &gt; Product Configuration</strong>&quot; from the main menu.</li>
  <li>Select &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.helprcp</strong>&quot; in the resulting &quot;<strong>New Product Configuration</strong>&quot;
  wizard page.</li>
  <li>Input &quot;<strong>helprcp.product</strong>&quot; into the &quot;<strong>File name</strong>&quot; text box.</li>
  <li>Select the &quot;<strong>Use an existing product</strong>&quot; radio button inside the &quot;<strong>Initialize
  the file content</strong>&quot; group and click &quot;<strong>Finish</strong>&quot;. The &quot;<strong>Product Configuration Editor</strong>&quot;
  will open.</li>
  <li>Input &quot;<strong>Help RCP Application</strong>&quot; into the &quot;<strong>Product Name</strong>&quot; text box.</li>
  <li>Verify &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.helprcp.product</strong>&quot; is the default value in the &quot;<strong>Product ID</strong>&quot; drop down menu.</li>
  <li>Select &quot;<strong>File &gt; Save</strong>&quot; from the main menu.</li>
  <li>From the &quot;<strong>Overview</strong>&quot; tab of the &quot;<strong>Product Configuration Editor</strong>&quot; click on
  &quot;<strong>Launch an Eclipse Application</strong>&quot; and verify that the application launches.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Add Source Code</h3>

<p>In your rich client plug-in project you will find a class called
&quot;<strong>ApplicationActionBarAdvisor</strong>&quot;. Open this in an editor. You will make a few source
changes to add the help actions to the menu. Add the lines marked &quot;<strong>// NEW</strong>&quot; to the
class as follows:</p>

<pre>public class ApplicationActionBarAdvisor extends ActionBarAdvisor {

    // Actions - important to allocate these only in makeActions, and then use them
    // in the fill methods.  This ensures that the actions aren't recreated
    // when fillActionBars is called with FILL_PROXY.
    private IWorkbenchAction exitAction;
    private IWorkbenchAction aboutAction;
    private IWorkbenchAction showHelpAction; <strong>// NEW</strong>
    private IWorkbenchAction searchHelpAction; <strong>// NEW</strong>
    private IWorkbenchAction dynamicHelpAction; <strong>// NEW</strong></pre>

<p>Add the lines marked &quot;<strong>// NEW</strong>&quot; to function
&quot;<strong>ApplicationActionBarAdvisor.makeActions()</strong>&quot; as follows:</p>

<pre> protected void makeActions(final IWorkbenchWindow window) {
    // Creates the actions and registers them.
    // Registering is needed to ensure that key bindings work.
    // The corresponding commands keybindings are defined in the plugin.xml file.
    // Registering also provides automatic disposal of the actions when
    // the window is closed.

    exitAction = ActionFactory.QUIT.create(window);
    register(exitAction);

    aboutAction = ActionFactory.ABOUT.create(window);
    register(aboutAction);

    showHelpAction = ActionFactory.HELP_CONTENTS.create(window); <strong>// NEW</strong>
    register(showHelpAction); <strong>// NEW</strong>

    searchHelpAction = ActionFactory.HELP_SEARCH.create(window); <strong>// NEW</strong>
    register(searchHelpAction); <strong>// NEW</strong>

    dynamicHelpAction = ActionFactory.DYNAMIC_HELP.create(window); <strong>// NEW</strong>
    register(dynamicHelpAction); <strong>// NEW</strong></pre>

<p>And add the lines marked &quot;<strong>// NEW</strong>&quot; to function
&quot;<strong>ApplicationActionBarAdvisor.fillMenuBar()</strong>&quot; as follows:</p>

<pre>protected void fillMenuBar(IMenuManager menuBar) {
   MenuManager fileMenu = new MenuManager(&quot;&amp;File&quot;, IWorkbenchActionConstants.M_FILE);
   MenuManager helpMenu = new MenuManager(&quot;&amp;Help&quot;, IWorkbenchActionConstants.M_HELP);

   menuBar.add(fileMenu);
   // Add a group marker indicating where action set menus will appear.
   menuBar.add(new GroupMarker(IWorkbenchActionConstants.MB_ADDITIONS));
   menuBar.add(helpMenu);

   // File
   fileMenu.add(newWindowAction);
   fileMenu.add(new Separator());
   fileMenu.add(messagePopupAction);
   fileMenu.add(openViewAction);
   fileMenu.add(new Separator());
   fileMenu.add(exitAction);

   // Help
   helpMenu.add(aboutAction);
   helpMenu.add(showHelpAction); <strong>// NEW</strong>
   helpMenu.add(searchHelpAction); <strong>// NEW</strong>
   helpMenu.add(dynamicHelpAction); <strong>// NEW</strong></pre>

<h3>Test</h3>

<p>Launch the application from the &quot;<strong>Product Configuration Editor</strong>&quot; and see what
happens. You will notice that the help menu now has additional entries for &quot;<strong>Help
Contents</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Search</strong>&quot; but neither of them does anything. This is because we
still need to import the plug-ins that comprise the Eclipse help system.</p>

<h3>Add Required Plug-ins</h3>

<ol>
  <li>In the &quot;<strong>Configuration</strong>&quot; tab of the &quot;<strong>Product Configuration Editor</strong>&quot; add &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.help.webapp</strong>&quot;
  and &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.help.ui</strong>&quot; to the list in the &quot;<strong>Plug-ins and Fragments</strong>&quot; section.</li>
  <li>Select the checkbox to &quot;<strong>Include optional dependencies when computing required
  plug-ins</strong>&quot;. 
  <div class="note"><img border="0" src="images/tip.gif" width="62" height="13"> If you
  omit this step the help system will not have all the plug-ins it needs and you
  will see an exception at startup.</div></li>
  <li>Click the &quot;<strong>Add Required Plug-ins</strong>&quot; button.</li>
  <li>Select &quot;<strong>File &gt; Save</strong>&quot; from the main menu.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Test Again</h3>

<p>Launch the application from the &quot;<strong>Product Configuration Editor</strong>&quot; again. Now
&quot;<strong>Help &gt; Help Contents</strong>&quot; will open a new window to display help.</p>

<p class = "figure"><img border="0" src="images/emptyHelp.png" width="689" height="550"></p>

<h3>Add Sample Help Content</h3>

<p>You can create a plug-in with help content as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select &quot;<strong>File &gt; New &gt; Project &gt; Plug-in project</strong>&quot;.</li>
  <li>On the first screen uncheck &quot;<strong>Create a Java Project</strong>&quot;</li>
  <li>Enter &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.helprcp.content</strong>&quot; in the &quot;<strong>Project name</strong>&quot; field and hit &quot;<strong>Next</strong>&quot; twice.</li>
  <li>From the templates page select &quot;<strong>Plug-in with sample help content</strong>&quot; and hit
  &quot;<strong>Finish</strong>&quot;.</li>
  <li>In the &quot;<strong>Product Configuration Editor</strong>&quot; add your new plug-in to the list in
  the &quot;<strong>Plug-ins and Fragments</strong>&quot; section.</li>
  <li>Launch the application from the &quot;<strong>Product Configuration Editor</strong>&quot;. It will look
  like this after you expand the nodes in the tree.</li>
</ol>

<p class = "figure"><img border="0" src="images/help.png" width="689" height="550"></p>

<p>&quot;<strong>Help &gt; Search</strong>&quot; is also enabled and looks like this. You will want to increase
the size of the help view.</p>

<p class = "figure"><img border="0" src="images/search.png" width="600" height="400"></p>

<h3>Add Context Help Support</h3>

<p>In this section you will add context help to the &quot;<strong>Message</strong>&quot; view included in the application.</p>

<p>The first thing you will need to do is create a context id for the view. To do this you
will need to modify the code for the &quot;<strong>View</strong>&quot; class in the
&quot;<strong>org.eclipse.helprcp</strong>&quot; project. Open it in an editor and add the
line marked &quot;<strong>// NEW</strong>&quot; to the &quot;<strong>View.createPartControl(Composite parent)</strong>&quot;
as follows:</p>

<pre>public void createPartControl(Composite parent) {
   Composite top = new Composite(parent, SWT.NONE);
   GridLayout layout = new GridLayout();
   layout.marginHeight = 0;
   layout.marginWidth = 0;
   top.setLayout(layout);
   PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getHelpSystem().setHelp(top, "org.eclipse.helprcp.message"); <strong>// NEW</strong></pre>

<p>After adding the code, you will have an error. To resolve it select &quot;<strong>Source &gt; Organize Imports</strong>&quot;
from the main menu. Save your changes when you are done.</p>

<p>Once the context id is created you need to create content to associate to it.
We will put the content in the &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.helprcp.content</strong>&quot; plug-in.
Add a new file to the root directory for the project called &quot;<strong>contexts.xml</strong>&quot;.
Open the new file in an editor, input the following text and save your changes:</p>

<pre>&lt;contexts&gt;
   &lt;context id="message"&gt;
      &lt;description&gt;This is the sample context-sensitive help. There is a link to the help content below.&lt;/description&gt;
      &lt;topic href="html/subtopic.html" label="Subtopic" /&gt;
   &lt;/context&gt;
&lt;/contexts&gt;</pre>

<p>Next you will need to link the content to the context id. This can be done as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the &quot;<strong>Plug-in Manifest Editor</strong>&quot; for the
  &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.helprcp.content</strong>&quot; plug-in.</li>
  <li>Switch to the &quot;<strong>Extensions</strong>&quot; tab and click
  the &quot;<strong>Add...</strong>&quot; button.</li>
  <li>In the &quot;<strong>New Extension</strong>&quot; wizard select the
  &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.help.context</strong>&quot; extension point and click &quot;<strong>Finish</strong>&quot;.
  <div class="note"><img border="0" src="images/tip.gif" width="62" height="13"> You will need to uncheck the
  &quot;<strong>Show only extension points from the required plug-ins</strong>&quot; checkbox to select the extension point.</div></li>
  <li>You will be asked if you want to add a dependency to the &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.help</strong>&quot;
  plug-in. Click &quot;<strong>No</strong>&quot;.</li>
  <li>Right-click your new extension in the list and select &quot;<strong>New &gt; contexts</strong>&quot;</li>
  <li>In the &quot;<strong>file</strong>&quot; field enter &quot;<strong>contexts.xml</strong>&quot;.</li>
  <li>In the &quot;<strong>plug-in</strong>&quot; field enter &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.helprcp</strong>&quot;.</li>
  <li>Select &quot;<strong>File &gt; Save</strong>&quot; from the main menu.</li>
</ol>

<p>The last step required to ensure that the correct context is sent to the help system
is to forward focus to the view's composite when its &quot;<strong>setFocus()</strong>&quot; method is called.
To do this you will first have to make the composite a private variable. In
class &quot;<b>View</b>&quot; add the line marked &quot;<strong>// NEW</strong>&quot;
in the code segment below and update the line marked &quot;<strong>// MODIFIED</strong>&quot; as indicated:</p>

<pre>public static final String ID = "org.eclipse.helprcp.view";
private Composite top; <strong>// NEW</strong>

public void createPartControl(Composite parent) {
   top = new Composite(parent, SWT.NONE); <strong>// MODIFIED</strong>
   GridLayout layout = new GridLayout();</pre>

<p>Next add content to the &quot;<strong>View.setFocus()</strong>&quot; method as follows:</p>

<pre>public void setFocus() {
   if(top != null) <strong>// NEW</strong>
      top.setFocus(); <strong>// NEW</strong>
}</pre>

<h3>Test context help</h3>

<p>Context-sensitive help should now be configured for the Message view. To test it, run your application again,
select the view titled &quot;<strong>Message</strong>&quot; and choose &quot;<strong>Help &gt; Dynamic Help</strong>&quot; from the main menu. When you do this,
you should see the following:</p>

<div class = "figure"><img border="0" src="images/context.png" width="600" height="400"></div>

<h3>Setting Help Preferences</h3>

<p>Any eclipse based product has the option to customize the default preferences of the plug-ins it ships with.
This is no different for your RCP application. To customize the help system settings you will first need to create
a &quot;<strong>plugin_customization.ini</strong>&quot; file and reference it from your product plug-in's
&quot;<strong>plugin.xml</strong>&quot;. To setup the file, perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Create a new file called &quot;<strong>plugin_customization.ini</strong>&quot; in the root of
 the &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.helprcp</strong>&quot; project. Leave it empty for now.</li>
 <li>Open the &quot;<strong>Plug-in Manifest Editor</strong>&quot; for the
 &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.helprcp.content</strong>&quot; plug-in.</li>
 <li>Switch to the &quot;<strong>Extensions</strong>&quot; tab and expand the
 &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.core.runtime.products</strong>&quot; node.</li>
 <li>Right click on &quot;<strong>Help RCP Application (product)</strong>&quot; and select
 &quot;<strong>New &gt; property</strong>&quot; from the context menu.</li>
 <li>Enter &quot;<strong>preferenceCustomization</strong>&quot; in the &quot;<strong>name</strong>&quot;
 field and &quot;<strong>plugin_customization.ini</strong>&quot; in the &quot;<strong>value</strong>&quot; field.</li>
 <li>Select &quot;<strong>File &gt; Save</strong>&quot; from the main menu.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once the file is configured for the product, you can place name/value pairs as specified in the following
help document to customize the help system:</p>

<p><a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help33/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/guide/ua_help_setup_preferences.htm">
http://help.eclipse.org/help33/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/guide/ua_help_setup_preferences.htm</a></p>

<p>The most common usage of this functionality is to control the order in which contributed parts of the table of contents are
 displayed for your product
or to hide parts of the table of contents that some of your plug-ins contribute. Both of these can be done with the
&quot;<strong>HELP_DATA</strong>&quot; property. This property references a plug-in relative path to an xml file that
contains the toc ordering and hiding information. For instance, if you created
&quot;<strong>helpData.xml</strong>&quot; in the root of your product plug-in you would put a line reading
&quot;<strong>org.eclipse.help/HELP_DATA=helpData.xml</strong>&quot; in your &quot;<strong>plugin_customization.ini</strong>&quot; file.
Here is a small sample of the xml file format:</p>

<pre>&lt;extensions&gt;
 &lt;tocOrder&gt;
  &lt;toc id="/org.eclipse.helprcp.content/testToc.xml"/&gt;
  &lt;toc id="/org.eclipse.other.content/toc.xml"/&gt;
 &lt;/tocOrder&gt;
 &lt;hidden&gt;
  &lt;toc id="/org.eclipse.third.content/toc.xml"/&gt;
 &lt;/hidden&gt;
&lt;/extensions&gt;</pre>

<p>This sample would display your table of contents from the &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.helprcp.content</strong>&quot;
plug-in first followed by the referenced book from the &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.other.content</strong>&quot; plug-in.
It would also hide the contents of the toc referenced from the &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.third.content</strong>&quot;
plug-in. Note that the &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.other.content</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>org.eclipse.third.content</strong>&quot;
plug-ins do not exist and are simply used as an example. For more information on the format of the xml file, see it's schema
from the help documentation:</p>
