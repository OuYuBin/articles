		The Rich Client Platform (RCP) lets you reuse common
		functionality from the Eclipse IDE for use in your own
		applications. Parts 1 and 2 of this tutorial introduced you to
		the platform with a very simple example that did nothing but
		open a blank window. Part 3 discusses a more complicated example
		with menus, views, and other features. This part has been
		updated for Eclipse 3.1.2.
