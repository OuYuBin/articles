		The Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) provides a framework for
		creating visual editors while being model agnostic. In most
		cases, people bring their own model which tend to be based on
		Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs). An alternative using POJOs is
		the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), which provides many
		features for manipulating models that aren't found in POJOs. The
		purpose of this article is to build upon the shapes example
		provided by GEF using the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and
		to provide an introduction using EMF based models in GEF based
		editors.
