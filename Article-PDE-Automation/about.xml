		Eclipse offers the possibility to build plug-ins automatically
		outside the Eclipse IDE, which is called "headless build".
		Eclipse itself is built headless and since Eclipse is an
		assembly of plug-ins, this feature is also available for any
		other plug-in. Although the set up of automatic building and
		testing requires only a couple of files, it can be tedious work
		to do nonetheless. This article shares the experiences and
		lessons learned while setting up automatic building and testing
		for an Open-Source Eclipse plug-in called RDT, Ruby Development
		Tools.
