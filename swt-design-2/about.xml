		This is the second in a series of articles about the design ideas behind
		SWT. SWT uses operating system resources to deliver its native
		graphics and widget functionality. Allocating and freeing
		operating system resources is traditionally an area of
		programming that is error prone. Languages that include garbage
		collection, such as the Java&trade;
		language, relieve the programmer from the burden of managing
		memory, but not from the allocation and freeing of operating
		system resources. This article discusses the simple strategy
		used by SWT to help application designers manage operating
		system resources.
