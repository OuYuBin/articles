		The traditional Hello World program doesn't do that much, but it
		can be invaluable when exploring a new development environment.
		In this article we'll develop the Eclipse Hello World plug-in
		and show you how to integrate it with the Eclipse Workbench.
		After you read this article you should know how to use the
		Eclipse Java Development Tooling to create, run, and debug a
		simple plug-in that extends the Eclipse Platform. You'll see how
		to setup a project for your plug-in, edit the Java code,
		compile, and run or debug your plug-in in another launched copy
		of Eclipse. We'll be looking at plug-in manifest files,
		extensions, and extension points to see how plug-ins are
		described to Eclipse and how they are integrated with the
		Platform.
