  <b>Summary</b><br>
  In this article we look at how to create branding for your Eclipse-based
  application. Branding is how you change the high level visual elements of your
  product. This includes items such as the splash screen, the about dialog, and
  the program executable.

<hr width="100%">
<h2>Intended Audience</h2>
<p>You have completed the functionality of your RCP based application but are
unhappy because it still looks too much like a default Eclipse application. It
is time to &quot;brand your product,&quot; which consists of changing aspects
such as the icon used by the launcher, the splash screen, the window image, and
more. This article will help you to accomplish these tasks and will point you to
other documents of interest.</p>
<h2>Reading this article</h2>
<p>This article has been separated into three main sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#product_branding">Product branding</a></li>
  <li><a href="#launcher_branding">Branding the launcher</a></li>
  <li><a href="#optional_branding">Optional branding</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As you work through the steps you may notice the occasional <img src="images/TryIt.gif" width="61" height="13">
image. These indicate points at which you may want to test out the work you have
done thus far.</p>
<p>The steps in this document assume that you have access to the SDK build but
all of the changes we described can be applied to any RCP based application. In
the remaining sections we assume that you have a working knowledge of Eclipse
based development. In particular we assume that you know how to provide
translatable strings for your plug-in (see <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help30/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/guide/product_def_nl.htm">Locale
specific files</a>).</p>
<p>Make sure that you have installed the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php">RCP
Runtime Binary</a> before continuing. You should not consider branding or
productization unless you are also including your own plug-ins. In this article
we use the RCP Browser Example as the target product. To help follow along with
examples, you should download this plug-in from the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.ui.examples.rcp.browser/">Eclipse
repository</a>.</p>
<p>NOTE: This article is intended to be a guide to help you produce a release.
You need to ensure that you comply with any terms and conditions of the license
under which you received the platform runtime.</p>
<h2><a name="product_branding">Product branding</a></h2>
<p>The branding changes we'll described are those aspects related to the
appearance of your running application. These branding elements are supplied
with the <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help30/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_core_runtime_products.html"><code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.product</code></a>
extension point. This controls (among other things) the application's title bar,
the window image, and the default application. We will describe parts of this
extension point here and will return to it in the <a href="#optional_branding">optional
branding</a> section.</p>
<h3>The product's title bar</h3>
<p><img name="Window's title bar" src="images/title.png" / width="400" height="52"></p>
<p>The product's title bar is controlled by the <code>name</code> attribute of
the product extension. Changing the browser's <code>plugin.xml</code> file as
highlighted below will replace the initial window title bar with your own
string.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;extension
      point=&quot;org.eclipse.core.runtime.products&quot;
      id=&quot;product&quot;&gt;
   &lt;product
         name=<font style="background-color: yellow" color="#0000FF">&quot;Branded RCP Browser Example&quot;</font>
         application=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.examples.rcp.browser.app&quot;&gt;
      &lt;property ...  </pre>
</blockquote>
<h3><b>The image the window system associates with the product</b></h3>
<p><img name="Window's title" src="images/windowImage.png" / width="400" height="52"></p>
<p>SWT allows a set of images to be associated with a shell with the expectation
that all images in the set will have the same appearance but be rendered at
different sizes. These images are provided to the SWT shell which is then able
to select the most appropriate one for each specific use. For example, on
Windows® the smaller image (16x16) will be used for the title and task bars
while the larger image (32x32) will appear in the Alt-Tab application switcher.</p>
<p>The comma-separated list that is set in the <i>windowImages</i> property
should have at least one image.</p>
Making the highlighted change to the <code>plugin.xml</code> file will change
the icons used by the product.
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;extension ...
   &lt;product ...
      &lt;property
          name=&quot;windowImages&quot; 
          value=<font style="background-color: yellow" color="#0000ff">&quot;icons/alt16.gif,icons/alt32.gif&quot;</font>/&gt;
      &lt;property ...  </pre>
</blockquote>
<h3><b>The name the window system associates with the product</b></h3>
<p>SWT allows an internal name to be associated with a shell. This name is
different from the one that appears in the shell's title bar -- its exact use
varies depending on the window system. For example, on X-Window based systems
such as motif this value is used to refer to the application in the .XDefaults
file.</p>
<p>The value of the <i>appName</i> property should be set to something that
clearly identifies your product. Its also a good idea to test your branding on a
platform (e.g., motif) that is known to use this value.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;extension ...
   &lt;product ...
      &lt;property
          name=&quot;appName&quot; 
          value=<font style="background-color: yellow" color="#0000ff">&quot;BrandedRCPBrowserExample&quot;</font>/&gt;
      &lt;property ...  </pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Setting the&nbsp;product's default&nbsp;application</h3>
<p>The products extension is used to apply branding to your application but you
must also provide an <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help30/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_core_runtime_applications.html">applications</a>
extension point. Among other thing this supplies the &quot;main&quot; to be run.
For example the Eclipse SDK has one brand but contains several applications
(e.g., the IDE, the ant runner, etc.) and for this specific case the IDE is the
default application.</p>
<p>You must designate a specific application as the default application to be
run when some branding is selected. This is accomplished by the <code>application</code>
attribute in your products extension.
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;extension
      point=&quot;org.eclipse.core.runtime.products&quot;
      id=&quot;product&quot;&gt;
   &lt;product
      <font style="background-color: yellow" color="#0000ff">application=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.examples.rcp.browser.app&quot;</font>
      ...</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3><img src="images/TryIt.gif" width="61" height="13">&nbsp;Testing the
branding while self-hosting</h3>
<p>In the Eclipse IDE create a new runtime-workbench launch configuration,
choose the &quot;Run a product&quot; option, and select <code>org.eclipse.ui.examples.rcp.browser.product</code>
from the dropdown.
<p>By default the launch configuration loads all workspace and enabled external
plug-ins which may cause problems when running your application (since several
unneeded plug-ins will be included). Create a minimal set of plug-ins by
choosing the &quot;Plug-ins&quot; tab and selecting &quot;Choose plug-ins and
fragments to launch from the list&quot;. Click on &quot;Deselect All&quot; and
then choose the <code>org.eclipse.ui.examples.rcp.browser</code> plug-in.
Finally click on &quot;Add Required Plug-ins&quot; to compute the minimal set of
plug-ins required for your application.</p>
<p>The images referenced in this example are already in the <code>icons/</code>
directory of the browser plug-in so after making the changes described in this
section you are ready to click on &quot;Run&quot; to launch your application.
Look for the new window images and title.</p>
<h2><a name="launcher_branding">Branding the launcher</a></h2>
<p>The next step in developing your overall product brand is to change the
elements that appear while launching your application. This includes aspects
such as using your own splash screen and changing the icon used by the Eclipse
launcher.</p>
<p>These changes apply to the Eclipse launcher, which is not used in
self-hosting mode. That means that in order to observe these changes you will
need to have your RCP application installed on your system so that you can start
it directly. It also means that we will be changing your RCP application's <code>config.ini</code>
file (in the configuration area (<code>eclipse/configuration</code>)) rather
than any of its extension points.</p>
<h3>Make your product active</h3>
<p>If you haven't already done so then now is the time to edit the <code>config.ini</code>
file so that your branding is selected when your application is launched. This
is accomplished by changing the value of the <code>eclipse.product</code>
property as shown here.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>eclipse.product = <font style="background-color: yellow" color="#0000ff">org.eclipse.ui.examples.rcp.browser.product</font>  </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>As described in <a href="#product_branding">Product branding</a> your <code>products</code>
extension point should point to your <code>applications</code> extension point.
Setting the value of this property will select your branding as well as your
application.
<h3>Replacing the splash screen</h3>
<p>The splash screen (shown while the program starts) is contained in one file
that is usually found in the plug-in declaring the product. It must be called <b>splash.bmp</b>
and must be a .BMP file. There are no constraints regarding the size but for
reference the standard Eclipse splash screen image is 500x330 pixels.</p>
<p>The splash screen is selected based on the value of the <code>osgi.splashPath</code>
property as shown here.
<blockquote>
  <pre>osgi.splashPath = <font style="background-color: yellow" color="#0000ff">platform:/base/plugins/org.eclipse.ui.examples.rcp.browser</font>  </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>When using <code>platform:</code> style URLs make sure that the plug-in
referenced is in the plug-ins folder and that it is a sibling of the startup.jar.</p>
<p>To use NL'ed splash screens the locale specific images should be placed in a <code>nl</code>
directory within the plug-in's directory. For example, a splash screen for the <code>fr_FR</code>
locale would be placed within the plug-in's directory as <code>nl/fr/FR</code>,
e.g.,
<blockquote>
  <pre>org.eclipse.ui.examples.rcp.browser/
  nl/
    fr/
      FR/
        splash.bmp    </pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Replacing the launcher's icon</h3>
<p>Changing the icon associated with the launcher requires modification to the
executable. We will also need to convert the icons into a resource that can be
used by the executable.</p>
<p>This process varies by platform, the following sections explain the procedure
for the Windows and Linux platforms. In both cases you should start by
extracting the file <code>eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.platform.source_3.0.0/src/org.eclipse.platform_3.0.0/launchersrc.zip</code>
found in the SDK. In the following sections, we will work with the <code>library/</code>
directory and once we are finished we will copy the resulting executable back to
the Browser application.</p>
<h4>Creating the graphic resources for our executable</h4>
<p><img src="images/win_only.gif" width="51" height="13">&nbsp;Windows
executable programs can have an associated icon(s). To create our icon we first
need to replace several .BMP graphics located in the <code>library</code>
directory. These graphics represent 16x16, 32x32 and 48x48 pixel versions of
both low color and high color graphics. In the <code>library/</code> directory
replace the following files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>icon16_basic.bmp</li>
  <li>icon16_full.bmp</li>
  <li>icon32_basic.bmp</li>
  <li>icon32_full.bmp</li>
  <li>icon48_basic.bmp</li>
  <li>icon48_full.bmp</li>
</ul>
<p>Using an appropriate graphics tool (e.g. ICONPRO provided in the MSDN),
combine these graphics into a single .ICO (icon) file called <code>eclipse.ico</code>
and replace <code>library/win32/eclipse.ico</code> with your new eclipse.ico
file. The <code>eclipse.ico</code> is referenced by the file <code>library/win32/eclipse.rc</code>
which is automatically used when the build script is run. Once the build script
has finished we will have a new program executable with an associated icon.</p>
<p><img src="images/linux_only.gif" width="51" height="13">&nbsp;Linux does not
directly associate an icon with an executable program however we can include an
icon that users can use when associating a shortcut with the program. Use your
favorite graphics editor to create an xpm graphic representing your program icon
and place it into <code>library/icon.xpm</code>. Once we have built the
executable we will copy both the executable and the <code>.xpm</code> file to
the <code>eclipse/</code> root directory of the platform runtime build.</p>
<h4>Building the executable</h4>
<p>Executable icon in hand, it's time to make the executable. We will continue
to work with the <code>library/</code> directory and once we have created our
executable we will copy it to the <code>eclipse/</code> root directory of the
runtime platform build. The process for creating the program executable is
different and a build script is provided in each subfolder to help make the
process easier.</p>
<h4>Preparing the build script</h4>
<p><img src="images/win_only.gif" width="51" height="13">&nbsp;In the <code>library/win32</code>
directory you will find the build script <code>build.bat</code>. We will need to
edit this build file to point it to the location of your C compiler. To do this,
simply uncomment the following lines (by removing <code>rem</code>) and modify <code>MSVC_HOME</code>
to point to the root directory of your compiler installation.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>rem IF NOT &quot;%MSVC_HOME%&quot;==&quot;&quot; GOTO MAKE
rem set MSVC_HOME=k:\dev\products\msvc60\vc98
rem call %MSVC_HOME%\bin\vcvars32.bat  </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This script has been tested with Microsoft® Visual C/C++ Compiler 6.0
however it is possible that you may need to make additional modifications for
your compiler.</p>
<p><img src="images/linux_only.gif" width="51" height="13">&nbsp;The Linux build
script (<code>build.csh)</code> has been tested against GNU C and C++ Compiler.
You typically should not need to make any changes to the Linux build script.</p>
<h4>Running the build script</h4>
<p>The build script takes two arguments, the filename of the executable file to
create (output) and the title (name) of your program. If the program name has
spaces in it (as in the example below) you will need to put double-quotes around
it.</p>
<p>In the example below the program name <i>RCP Browser</i> will be shown in the
task bar while the program is starting.</p>
<p><img src="images/win_only.gif" width="51" height="13">&nbsp;On Windows you
can run the build script (<code>build.bat</code>) as shown below. Prior to
running the build script you should run once using the <code>clean</code> target
to remove any artifacts from previous builds. This example will create an
executable file named <code>rcp browser.exe</code> with the icon we created
above.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>build -output &quot;rcp browser.exe&quot; -name &quot;RCP Browser&quot;  </pre>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="images/linux_only.gif" width="51" height="13">&nbsp;On Linux you
can run the build script (<code>build.csh)</code> as shown below. This example
will create an executable file named <i>rcp browser</i>. On Linux an icon is not
automatically associated with the executable.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>csh build.csh -output &quot;rcp browser&quot; -name &quot;RCP Browser&quot;  </pre>
</blockquote>
<h4>Replacing the existing executable</h4>
<p>Now that you have your own executable, you can copy it to the
code&gt;eclipse/ root directory of the browser example. It is a good idea to
remove the previous executable so that the user won't be confused on which to
run.</p>
<p><img src="images/linux_only.gif" width="51" height="13">&nbsp;On Linux we
also need to copy the <code>icon.xpm </code>(we created above) to the <code>eclipse/
</code>root replacing the one already found there.</p>
<p><img src="images/TryIt.gif" width="61" height="13">&nbsp;Start your
application by running the executable you just built. Confirm that it starts
properly and that your icons, splash screen, and program name are shown during
the application launch process.
<h2><a name="optional_branding">Optional branding</a></h2>
<p>Previous sections have discussed changes that all applications will want to
make in order to present a customized brand. In this section we discuss some
optional aspects of branding such as customizing the about dialog, applying your
own default preferences, and selecting a special presentation.</p>
<h3><b>The about dialog</b></h3>
<p>Both the image and the text in the main about dialog are subject to product
level branding.</p>
<p><img name="About dialog" src="images/about.png" width="479" height="281">
<p>These values are set from properties in your <code>products</code> extension
point as shown here</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;extension ...
   &lt;product ...
      &lt;property
          name=&quot;aboutImage&quot; 
          value=<font style="background-color: yellow" color="#0000ff">&quot;icons/alt_about.gif&quot;</font>/&gt;
      &lt;property
          name=&quot;aboutText&quot; 
          value=<font style="background-color: yellow" color="#0000ff">&quot;The about dialog text can contain links such as http://www.eclipse.org.&quot;</font>/&gt;
      &lt;property ...  </pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The absolute maximum size for an the about image is 500x330 pixels. However,
the value of the about text property will only be displayed if the about image
is no larger than 250x300 pixels.</p>
<h3>Special preferences settings used by the product</h3>
<p>Although not shown in this example it is also possible to specify a set of
defaults that should be used with the product. For example, the preference
settings might be used to specify an alternate presentation factory. The
preferences should be stored in a file which is pointed to by the <i>preferenceCustomization</i>
property. See <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/platform-ui-home/rcp/index.html#rcp_and_r21">Eclipse
Rich Client Platform</a> for an example.</p>
<h3>The <code>.eclipseproduct</code> marker file</h3>
<p>The branding of the application would not be complete without updating <code>eclipse/.eclipseproduct</code>.
This marker file is a <code>java.io.Properties</code> format file that indicates
the name, id, and version of the product. It also controls things like the
default configuration area inside the user home folder, which ensure a
separation of the configuration information among products.</p>
<p>Ensure the file exists in you <code>eclipse/</code> directory and contains:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>name=<font style="background-color: yellow" color="#0000ff">Branded RCP Browser Example</font>
id=<font style="background-color: yellow" color="#0000ff">org.eclipse.ui.examples.rcp.browser.product</font>
version=<font style="background-color: yellow" color="#0000ff">3.0.0</font>  </pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Presentations</h3>
<p>A very powerful way to supply branding to your application is to create your
own presentation. Supplying your own <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help30/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_presentationFactories.html">presentationFactory</a>
allows you to change all aspects of your application's UI. You can find an
example of using the R21 presentation on the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/platform-ui-home/rcp/index.html#rcp_and_r21">Eclipse
RCP page</a>.
<h3>Intro page</h3>
<p>Eclipse allows you to supply an extension point to provide a customized intro
experience to users of your application. Explore the Eclipse help system for
more information on how to use the <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help30/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/extension-points/org_eclipse_ui_intro.html">org.eclipse.ui.intro</a>
extension.
<h2><a name="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2>
<h4><a name="osgi_bundles"></a><b>Application &quot;...&quot; could not be found
in the registry. The applications available are: &lt;NONE&gt;</b></h4>
<p>Use the error log to check that all pre-requisite plug-ins were successfully
resolved. The <code>osgi.bundles</code> property lists the plug-ins that eclipse
installs and runs.</p>
<p>Typically only <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime</code> and <code>org.eclipse.update.configurator</code>
are listed. The update configurator will discover and install all plug-ins in
the <code>plugins</code> directory. If you aren't using <code>org.eclipse.update.configurator</code>
then list all necessary plug-ins in the <code>osgi.bundles</code> property.</p>
<p>A typical RCP list might look like:</p>
<pre>osgi.bundles = org.eclipse.core.runtime@2:start, org.eclipse.core.expressions, \
               org.eclipse.help, org.eclipse.jface, org.eclipse.osgi.services, \
               org.eclipse.osgi, org.eclipse.swt, org.eclipse.ui.workbench, \
               org.eclipse.ui, org.eclipse.swt.win32, org.eclipse.swt.gtk, \
               org.eclipse.swt.gtk64, org.eclipse.swt.carbon, \
               org.eclipse.swt.motif</pre>
<h4><a name="no_app_id"></a><b>No application id has been found.</b></h4>
<p>This happens when eclipse cannot find the application to run. This could
happen if the product cannot be found or the default application specified in
the product extension is not found. Check for typos in both these ids.</p>
<h4><a name="app_id_typo"></a><b>Application &quot;...&quot; could not be found
in the registry. The applications available are: ...</b></h4>
<p>This is most likely caused by a typo in the application id. If you are using
your product's default application then check the <i>application</i> attribute
in the product extension. Otherwise check the <code>eclipse.application</code>
property in the <code>config.ini</code> file. The value must match the id
defined in some application extension.</p>
<h4><a name="product_id_typo"></a><b>No branding in application</b></h4>
<p>This happens when the product cannot be found check the <code>config.ini</code>
file for typos in the value of <code>eclipse.product</code>.</p>
<h4><a name="clean"></a><b>Changes ignored</b></h4>
<p>If changes to <code>plugin.xml</code> or <code>plugin.properties</code> are
not recognized then try running once with the <code>-clean</code> command line
option. This will remove stale cache files to ensure they are regenerated from
the newest information. This option is only required during development when the
plug-in manifest is changing it will not be needed when your product is
deployed.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have shown how to replace the basic units of branding to make your product
look like your own. This included such items as the splash screen, about dialog
and the icon and name associated with the launcher.</p>
