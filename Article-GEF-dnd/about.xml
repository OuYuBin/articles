		Native drag and drop provides the ability to drag data from one
		GUI object to another GUI object, which could potentially be in
		another application. GEF allows access to the operating system's
		underlying drag and drop infrastructure through SWT. This
		article will provide an in-depth look at GEF&#39;s drag and drop
		functionality and show some simple examples of how to take
		advantage of this API.
