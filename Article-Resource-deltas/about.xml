		Many tools and user interface elements are interested in
		processing resource changes as they happen. For example, the
		task list wants to update new or changed markers, the navigator
		wants to reflect added and deleted resources, and the Java
		compiler wants to recompile modified Java files. Such
		notifications are potentially costly to compute, manage and
		broadcast. The Eclipse Platform resource model includes a series
		of mechanisms for efficiently notifying clients of resource
		changes. This article outlines these facilities and gives some
		examples of their use.
