		Congratulations on taking the plunge and writing an open source
		plug-in for the Eclipse platform. SourceForge.net can provide a
		good home your plug-in, but information on how best to set up an
		Eclipse project there is sparse. This article is an introduction
		to SourceForge for the Eclipse developer. You will learn the
		features available to the SourceForge.net open source developer
		community and be guided through the process, from creating a
		SourceForge project to hosting your Eclipse Update site.
