		This article describes how the Eclipse 3.1 workbench works, in
		particular the infrastructure for views and editors. The goal is
		to teach you about important classes in the workbench, and how
		they interact. A familiarity with the basic workbench APIs for
		views, editors, action sets, and so forth is assumed.
