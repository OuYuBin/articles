		Populating a table or tree widget involves creating items and
		setting their attributes (eg.- texts, images, etc.), after which
		the table or tree takes responsibility for displaying the items.
		This approach makes item creation straightforward and visually
		consistent. As of Eclipse 3.2, clients of Table and Tree can now
		custom draw their items, enabling a wide range of potential
		visual appearances. This article explores the custom draw
		mechanism for Table and Tree.
