		This article discusses two central mechanisms that are
		associated with projects in an Eclipse workspace. The first of
		these is incremental project builders, which create some built
		state based on the project contents, and then keep that built
		state synchronized as the project contents change. The second is
		project natures, which define and manage the association between
		a given project and a particular plug-in or feature. The purpose
		and uses of builders and natures will be described in detail,
		and working examples will be provided to highlight the finer
		details of implementing them for your own plug-in. This article
		is intended to supplement, rather than replace, the
		documentation on builders and natures found in the Eclipse
		Platform Plug-in Developer Guide.
