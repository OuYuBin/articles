		Managing images in a large graphical application can be a
		daunting task. Since modern operating systems such as Windows&reg;
		only support a small number of images in memory at once, an
		application's icons and background images must be carefully
		managed and sometimes shared between widgets. This article
		describes the image management facilities provided by the
		Eclipse Platform, along with some best practice guidelines to
		keep in mind when writing your own Eclipse UI plug-ins. We
		assume the reader already has a basic understanding of Eclipse,
		the UI extension points defined by the Eclipse Platform, and the
		Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT).
