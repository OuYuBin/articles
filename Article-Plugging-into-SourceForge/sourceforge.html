      <p><b>Summary</b></p>

      <p>Congratulations on taking the plunge and writing an open source
      plug-in for the Eclipse platform.
      SourceForge.net can provide a good home your plug-in, but
      information on how best to set up an Eclipse project there is sparse.
      This article is an introduction to SourceForge for the Eclipse
      developer. You will learn the features available to the
      SourceForge.net open source developer community and be guided
      through the process, from creating a SourceForge project to
      hosting your Eclipse Update site.</p>

    <h3>SourceForge: A site for everything open source and nothing in
    particular</h3>

    <div><img align="right" alt="SourceForge.net logo"
     src="images/SourceForge.net.png"
     style="margin:5px; width: 210px; height: 62px;" title="SourceForge.net"/></div>

    <p><a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net</a> (or
    simply SourceForge) is the world's largest open source
    software repository and developer resource. Just as Eclipse is an
    &quot;<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-UI-Guidelines/v200202/Contents.html"
    >IDE for everything and nothing in particular</a>&quot;,
    SourceForge is a developer site for everything open source and
    nothing in particular. Similar to how an Eclipse plug-in plugs into
    the Eclipse framework through extensions of well-known extension
    points, open source projects &quot;plug into&quot; the rich
    collaboration community hosted by SourceForge.</p>

    <p>SourceForge is language and platform agnostic &mdash;
    it may be Java, .Net, Perl,
    Ruby, PHP, or any other software project. For each project, regardless of
    language or platform, a wide array of services is freely
    available. The project 'extension points' include server
    space for a project web site, your own project sub-domain, a CVS
    server, file release management, GNU Mailman mailing lists, project
    categorization, on-line discussion forums, bug tracking, secure
    login shell and FTP, a compile farm, task lists and even an on-line
    financial donation management.</p>

    <div><img align="right"
     alt="SFPDE - SourceForge Plug-In Development Environment"
     src="images/sfpde-med.png" style="margin: 5px;width: 360px; height: 265px;"
     title="SFPDE - SourceForge Plug-In Development Environment"/></div>

    <p>There are too many services available to cover in this article,
    so I present one common scenario &mdash; the creation of a new project
    &mdash; and I introduce features as they come into play in the life
    cycle of developing, publishing, and supporting an open source
    plug-in for Eclipse.</p>

    <p>You will see how SourceForge extends the Eclipse Plug-in
    Development Environment (PDE) to create what I refer to as the
    SourceForge <strong>Plug-in Development Environment</strong>
    (SFPDE). Eclipse provides the coding, testing, debugging, and
    packaging aspects of Plug-in development. The SFPDE adds the source
    management, distribution, collaboration, discovery, web hosting,
    and support capabilities. The combined SFPDE services offer a
    comprehensive environment for Eclipse plug-ins
    development.</p>

    <p>I will use a humble plug-in that I wrote and released on
    SourceForge as an example (the
    <a href="http://eclipseexeditor.sourceforge.net/">Eclipse Text
    Editor Extensions</a> ), so you can refer to a concrete plug-in
    project.</p>

    <p>For this article, I assume that you are already familiar with
    writing Eclipse plug-ins, and you have an idea that will
    revolutionize the Eclipse community: if only you had a way to share
    it as an open source project! You have some code to commit to CVS
    and would like to attract one or two open source contributors
    to help you polish it off. I also assume you are familiar with
    most of the concepts of open source projects, including license
    models, community involvement, patches and contributions, etc. If
    not, there are resources available at the
    <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source Initiative</a>
    (OSI).</p>

    <h3>Planning</h3>

    <p>As with any software endeavor, a little bit of planning will
    reduce your long-term frustration. With an open source project,
    you probably do not have a software manager and marketing
    department pushing you to release the new product, so you may
    actually have time for planning!</p>

    <p>This is an outline of an open source project's lifecycle
    within the SFPDE:</p>

      <li>Understanding the SourceForge open source Software model</li>

      <li>How to structure a SourceForge project</li>

    </ol>

    <h3>Plugging In</h3>

    <h4>Understanding the SourceForge open source Software model</h4>

    <p>Before you begin an open source project on SourceForge, be sure
    you understand the SourceForge definition of open source and its
    requirements for hosted projects. You should read and grok the
    SourceForge
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=6048&amp;group_id=1"
    >Terms of Use</a> , and be fully comfortable with the requirements
    outlined there. SourceForge users assume certain aspects
   of open source projects, so be sure you know what the open source and
   SourceForge communities will expect of you.</p>

    <h4>How to structure a SourceForge project</h4>

    <p>The next step in the planning process is to get your project in
    order before shipping it up to SourceForge. I have found that it
    is convenient to create four separate Eclipse projects. Below is
    the layout of my projects for my sample plug-in. I named the
    project based on the root Java package, net.sf.eclipseexeditor
    (described below).</p>

    <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="text-align: left; width: 600px;">

      <tbody>

        <tr>

          <th>Eclipse Project Description</th>

          <th>Example</th>

        </tr>

        <tr>

          <td>Your plug-in, as an Eclipse PDE project.</td>

          <td>net.sf.eclipseexeditor</td>

        </tr>

        <tr>

          <td>Your Plug-In Feature, created from the Eclipse feature
          wizard.</td>

          <td>net.sf.eclipseexeditor-feature</td>

        </tr>

        <tr>

          <td>Your update site, created from the Eclipse update site
          wizard.</td>

          <td>net.sf.eclipseexeditor-update-site</td>

        </tr>

        <tr>

          <td>Your web site, your public documentation.</td>

          <td>net.sf.eclipseexeditor-web-site</td>

        </tr>

      </tbody>

    </table>

    <p>Some projects may have several plug-ins, each with its own PDE
    project. For example, solareclipse has the following project/file
    structure:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>net.sf.solareclipse-feature</li>

      <li>net.sf.solareclipse-home</li>

      <li>net.sf.solareclipse.jsp.ui</li>

      <li>net.sf.solareclipse.ui</li>

      <li>net.sf.solareclipse.xml.core</li>

      <li>net.sf.solareclipse.xml.ui</li>

      <li>net.sf.solareclipse.xslt.debug.core</li>

      <li>net.sf.solareclipse.xslt.debug.ui</li>

      <li>net.sourceforge.solareclipse.web.ui</li>

      <li>net.sourceforge.solareclipse.xml.core</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Be sure to review your project's names before committing to
    CVS: the project name will become the CVS module name. The
    solareclipse project's
    <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/solareclipse/">
    CVS</a> tree has apparently obsolete modules named
    <code>org.sourceforge.solareclipse.web.ui</code> and a misspelled
    <code>net.courceforge.solareclipse.web.ui</code> module.</p>

    <p>You may also find it convenient to define
    <a href="images/working-set.png">an Eclipse Working Set</a> that
    contains all your projects. This can help with restricted file
    searches in Eclipse, i.e. text/file searches for classes or package
    names in plugin.xml or web site content, in case you need to rename
    classes or packages. Note that you can host <strong>all</strong>
    your related Eclipse PDE projects within a single SFPDE project
    space.</p>

    <h4>Naming the project</h4>

    <p>Patterns, packages, projects have more in common than their
    first letter. In all cases, a good name cannot be beat. Sadly,
    my project name (eclipseexeditor) is not a good example. It was
    only after I had created my SourceForge project and worked on it
    significantly that I realized that ETEE &mdash; an acronym for
    Eclipse Text Editor Extensions &mdash; would have been a better
    choice.</p>

    <p>Your SourceForge project name will be used everywhere in
    SourceForge: in the Unix file system as the directory name, as a
    CVS root, as a component of a domain name/URL &mdash;
    <a href="http://eclipseexeditor.sf.net">
    http://eclipseexeditor.sf.net</a>, in your project's summary
    page url &mdash; <a href="http://sf.net/projects/eclipseexeditor">
    http://sf.net/projects/eclipseexeditor</a> , in Mailman mailing
    lists names, etc. In other words, choose a name that is easy for
    your users to use and remember and that still conveys the purpose
    of your project. SourceForge does not support renaming projects
    after their creation.</p>

    <p>Here are the SourceForge rules for a project name:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>It must begin with a letter</li>

      <li>It must be between 3 and 15 characters in length</li>

      <li>It can only contain only lowercase letters (a-z), numbers
      (0-9), and dashes (&quot;-&quot;) or underscores
      (&quot;_&quot;)</li>

      <li>It cannot match the name of any other project or one of
      SourceForge's reserved names</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Once again, remember that you cannot change the project name after its creation... so
     be sure you are happy with the name!</p>

    <h4>Naming the Java package</h4>

    <p>Since we are talking naming, it is a good idea to
    consider carefully the Java packages names for your plug-ins.   If you are
    part of a commercial organization or org site that is sponsoring
    the plug-in development, you may wish to release the plug-in as a
    specific package within that name space, such as the veloedit
    Velocity editor: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/veloedit/"
    ><code>org.vaulttec.velocity.ui</code></a> . Presumably, one should
    not use <code>org.eclipse</code> as a base package name, as that
    name space is reserved for official Eclipse projects at
    www.eclipse.org. I chose the pattern of <code>net.sf.</code> +
    <i><code>projectname</code></i> (i.e.
    <code>net.sf.eclipseexeditor</code> ) over something like
    <code>org.biesack</code> so that the code base will feel more
    &quot;open&quot; to other contributors. After all, a key aspect of
    an open source project is that potential collaborators feel
    welcome.</p>

    <p>Other projects on SourceForge have followed this example, such
    as <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/solareclipse/">
    net.sf.solareclipse</a> and
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lunar-eclipse/">
    net.sf.lunar_eclipse</a> . Note that if you wish to follow this
    pattern, you should avoid using a dash in your project name, which
    is illegal in Java. The biggest reason to use this format is that
    it follows
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/packages.doc.html#40169"
    >Sun's recommended package naming convention</a> of reversing
    the domain name. Since your domain name will be
    <code><i>projectname</i>.sourceforge.net</code> or
    <code><i>projectname</i>.sf.net</code> , this leads to a Java
    package name space of <code>net.sf.<i>projectname</i></code>. Other
    projects do not follow Sun's recommendations. For
    example, <a href="http://sfutils.sourceforge.net/">sfutils</a> has
    packages like <code>sfutils.frs</code> with no <code>net</code>
    or <code>org</code> or <code>com</code> prefix.</p>

    <h4>Choosing a license</h4>

    <p>SourceForge has a well-defined specification
    for open source projects, including a license. SourceForge requires
    that you use either an approved an approved open source initiative
    license, or a license that complies with the
    <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">open source definition</a>. See the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=778&amp;group_id=1"
    >B6. open source license overview</a> for more details: &quot;<cite>It is vital that you read and
    understand all of the terms of a license, and verify that it meets
    the needs of your project, before deciding to use that license;
    this should not be a decision taken lightly.</cite> &quot;</p>

    <p>The license you select can also influence
    your ability to draw contributors to your plug-in. In addition, changing a license later often
    alienates your user and contributing developers' community.
    Eclipse plug-in developers may want
    to consider the
    <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-1.0.php">
    Eclipse Public License</a> (EPL), an <a href="http://opensource.org"
    >OSI approved</a> and SourceForge acceptable license. By choosing
    EPL, you will be using the same license as the Eclipse.org
    projects, and your plug-in license will be compatible with future
    Eclipse developments.</p>

    <h4>Registering on SourceForge</h4>

    <p>Now that you have some of the planning done and your plug-in is
    complete enough for an initial code contribution, it is time to
    start your registration process. Naturally, SourceForge has an
    on-line web based registration process that guides you through the
    following steps:</p>

    <ol>

      <li>Hosting information</li>

      <li>Registering a project</li>

      <li>Terms of Use Agreement</li>

      <li>Hosting requirements</li>

      <li>Project license details</li>

      <li>Project description details</li>

      <li>Project name details</li>

      <li>Final review</li>

      <li>Submission completed</li>

    </ol>

    <p>There is plenty of documentation and help along the way. If
    you have done the suggested planning, this should only take 10 to
    15 minutes. Once your new project submission is complete, it will
    take a few days for the SourceForge staff to process the request
    and create your project.</p>

    <p>You start by logging into SourceForge. If you do not already
    have an account, simply click on the <strong>
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/account/newuser_emailverify.php"
    >New User via SSL</a></strong> link on the front page and enter
    your email address and a create a password. SourceForge will send
    an email to the address you supply to confirm it is a valid
    address. (If you have some spam filtering enabled, configure it to
    allow mail from the domain &quot;sourceforge.net&quot; and any
    sub domains). You must visit the confirmation URL in that email
    message. At this point, you will be able to choose an account user
    name.</p>

    <p>Next, log in using your userid and password, and then click the
    <strong><a href="http://sourceforge.net/register/">Register New
    Project</a></strong> link to begin the registration process. Review
    the Hosting information and the Terms of Use Agreement that you
    must accept before proceeding. You will need to supply some of the
    important information discussed above: your project name,
    license, a short public project description, and a longer project
    justification to help the SourceForge administrators understand how
    your project adds value or is different from existing solutions.</p>

    <p>Once you complete your registration, you must wait a few days
    for the SourceForge administrators to review your request and set
    up the infrastructure. You should receive an email response
    informing you of the project's creation when it is ready. You
    can check the status of any of your project requests by visiting
    your SourceForge home page:
    <code>http://sourceforge.net/users/<i>your-userid</i>/</code> .
    There, you can view all of your SourceForge projects. Also, on the
    '<a href="https://sourceforge.net/my/myprojects.php">my
    projects</a>' page you can see all your projects regardless of
    their approval status.</p>

    <p>When accepted, your project will also receive a unique numeric
    identifier, called a <i>group id</i>, used to access some project
    resources on SourceForge instead of the Unix project
    name.</p>

    <p>Once your project is created, the next step is to verify your
    project's public information in the Public Info section, and
    to classify your project in the <a>Trove Software Map</a>.</p>

    <h4>Understanding the Trove Classification</h4>

    <p>The Trove &mdash; or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/">
    software map</a> &mdash; is a software categorization and classification
    system to organize all SourceForge projects. The software map is
    one of the key links on the SourceForge front page. Together with
    your keywords and description, the Trove makes your
    plug-in easier to find.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the Trove organization does not always fit
    everyone's model. For example, although there is a top-level
    category for
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=45"
    >Software Development</a> , the topic
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=65"
    >Integrated Development Environments (IDE)</a> &mdash; a good location
    for many Eclipse plug-ins &mdash; is instead under the main topic
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=63"
    >Text Editors</a>.   I recommend placing Eclipse plug-ins that
    are un-related to Software Development &mdash; such as the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/morphine/">Eclipse RSS
    Reader</a> &mdash; in Trove categories that reflect
    their use, not their implementation technology.</p>

    <p>Using the software map, you will have the opportunity to select
    one to six, and sometimes more, project values in each of several
    categories: Topic, Operating System, Programming Language, License,
    Intended Audience, User Interface, Translations, Database
    Environment, and Development Status . Eclipse plug-in writers
    should include
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=583"
    ><strong>User Interface :: Plugins :: Eclipse</strong></a> in the
    set of User Interface values, and under Operating Systems, you may
    want to choose
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=235"
    ><strong>System :: Grouping and Descriptive Categories :: OS
    Portable (Source code to work with many OS platforms)</strong></a>
    . You can also use the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=472"
    ><strong>User Interface :: Graphical :: Java SWT</strong></a>
    category.</p>

    <p>Review carefully all the options to help your users locate
    your plug-in while browsing projects categories. See
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=12973&amp;group_id=1"
    >Software Search and the SourceForge.net Software Map</a> for
    details.</p>

    <p>Note also that you must add each classification one by one by
    selecting the value in a drop down list then clicking the Add
    button to its right. You cannot select values for several
    categories and add them all at once.</p>

    <h4>Using SourceForge's CVS server for Eclipse projects</h4>

    <p>Now that you have a project that other's can find,
    it is time to put some content there. The most important
    content is the source code, managed in a
    <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">Concurrent Versions System</a>
    (CVS) repository. Since Eclipse has built-in support for CVS
    repositories in the Team development plug-ins, it is
    straightforward to use within the SFPDE.</p>

    <p>Once approved, your project will have a CVS repository dedicated
    for it at
    <code>cvs.sourceforge.net/cvsroot/<i>yourprojectname</i></code> .
    For example, the net.sf.eclipseexeditor project is at
    <code>cvs.sourceforge.net/cvsroot/eclipseexeditor</code>.
    Here is my project's CVS view:</p>

    <p><img alt="Sample CVS project view" src="images/cvs-view.png"
     style="width: 407px; height: 222px;"
     title="Sample CVS project view"/></p>

    <p>You can visualize the project partitioning here: I use one directory
    for the PDE project source, one for the plug-in feature project,
    one for the update site project, and one for the web site.</p>

    <p>For each of your Eclipse projects, invoke the project's
    context menu from the Package Explorer view and select the menu
    Team -&gt;Share Project. Chose CVS and complete the Share Project
    wizard (see the
    <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help31/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/gettingStarted/qs-61f_syncproject.htm"
    >Eclipse help</a> for more details) to attach it to the SourceForge
    CVS repository. If instead you are going to be joining a project
    that already resides in CVS, you can simply check the project out
    of CVS using the standard Eclipse Team operations.   Once your CVS
    repository is defined in Eclipse, you can use the normal Team
    operations to commit your source to CVS by invoking Team-&gt;Commit
    from each of the project folders. I recommend keeping Eclipse
    metadata files &mdash; <code>.project</code> and <code>.classpath</code>
    &mdash; under version control  so that others can simply checkout
    the projects from Eclipse's CVS client. Eclipse will
    automatically detect the project's Java nature, and build path
    configuration.</p>

    <h4>Secure Services</h4>

    <p>To commit files to SourceForge's CVS servers and access the
    shell, you must use SSH.</p>

    <p>This means using the <code>extSSH</code> connection method if
    you want to use Eclipse's built-in CVS and SSH client, or
    using a properly configured <code>ext</code> method to rely on your
    favorite SSH client. SSH provides secure communication with the
    server through encryption.</p>

    <p>If your system already has a SSH implementation, you should be
    able to use it. SSH implementations are available on Macs and most Unix
    variants, including Linux. Windows users of the Cygwin tool
    set can use <a href="http://www.openSSH.org/">OpenSSH</a> , or
    users without Cygwin and OpenSSH can try <a href="http://www.putty.nl/">
    PUTTY</a> or another secure shell tool set.</p>

    <p>If available, SourceForge recommends using a tool set that uses
    the SSH2 protocol for greater security, which is the version
    supported by Eclipse's built-in CVS SSH client.</p>

    <p>You will also need SSH to copy files to your project's
    shell and web space. The SourceForge site help
    provides complete documentation to
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=6841&amp;group_id=1"
    >configure SSH</a>.   Windows users may also consider
    <a href="http://www.winscp.net">WinSCP</a> , a SourceForge
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/winscp">project</a> that
    provides drag and drop integration with Windows. For example, after
    you update your web site in Eclipse, you can open WinSCP, authenticate, then jump via a WinSCP favorite to your SourceForge
    project web space and <a href="images/WinSCP.png">drag files
    from the Eclipse Package Explorer</a> to the WinSCP view.</p>

    <h4>Making a software release</h4>

    <p>Software releases are the primary mechanism that SourceForge
    users employ to make downloads available software to their users.
    SourceForge supports a robust system for releasing your software.
    Released files are preserved for the lifetime of the project, allowing
    anyone to download previous releases &mdash; although you can hide
    releases if needed. Making a software release on SourceForge is
    well documented in the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=6445&amp;group_id=1"
    >Guide to the File Release System (FRS)</a>.</p>

    <p>SFPDE users can use the FRS to publish plug-in jar files. You
    should also release your plug-in source as part of each release.
    There are several ways to do this: you can include source in your
    jar file (to facilitate debugging in Eclipse) or you can use an
    Ant task to create a zip file of your source. The fewer the number
    of files in a release, the easier it is to manage, so it is best to
    minimize files by using archive files (jar files, zip files, tar.gz
    files, etc.) to collect the files for a release. Note that with open source projects, users often expect releases to
    contain the source. It is considered impolite to force users to fetch the
    source from CVS. Do not forget to include your license file in
    your release.</p>

    <p>To create a release, follow these steps:</p>

    <ol>

      <li>Login to SourceForge</li>

      <li>Select your project</li>

      <li>Go to the Admin panel for your project and select the File
      Releases link from the navigation menu to enter the FRS.</li>

      <li>Define a <em>FRS package</em> if none is defined.
      A FRS package a collection of files associated with a
      project; each plug-in can map to a FRS package.
      For my eclipseexeditor project, the FRS contains one package &mdash;
      eclipseexeditor &mdash; as shown in the
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=137861"
      >Files</a> page .</li>

      <li>Use anonymous FTP to upload files to upload.sourceforge.net.
      You may use your favorite FTP client for this. SourceForge does
      not provide anonymous web upload.</li>

      <li>Define a new release &mdash; typically named after the version
      number, such as 0.1, 1.0Beta2, 1.0, 2.0, etc. &mdash; for your package
      by using the SourceForge web interface.</li>

      <li>Add files from the anonymous FTP site to the release. The
      SourceForge web interface provides all you need for this &mdash; you
      add a new file to the release, select that file from the set of all
      files in the upload area and select a file type. Remember that other SourceForge users are
      building releases at the same time, so you will see other files
      there.</li>

      <li>Verify the release contents by downloading and installing the
      plug-in in a clean Eclipse installation.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>To create a new release, simply click the
    Add Release button and submit the web form to create a new release.
    You can then add the files from the anonymous upload site to the
    release.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">

      <p><img alt="File Release System - Add a Release"
       src="images/frs.png"
       title="File Release System - Add a Release"/></p>

    </div>

    <p>SourceForge offers download statistics for each released file.
    You can monitor how many people have downloaded your source zip or
    Eclipse plug-in. </p>

    <p>You may also want to have a look at the  <a href="http://sfutils.sourceforge.net">sfutils</a> package.
     It provides an Ant task and
    Java API to automate software releases on SourceForge. With
    sfutils, you can make a release directly from Eclipse by running
    Ant.</p>

    <h4>Building a web site</h4>

    <p>SourceForge provides enhanced web hosting for projects. In
    addition to basic HTML services, you get:</p>

    <ol>

      <li>DNS registration. The URL
      <code>http://yourprojectname.sourceforge.net</code> is reserved
      for your project web site. For example, my ETEE project is
      hosted at <a href="http://eclipseexeditor.sourceforge.net">
      http://eclipseexeditor.sourceforge.net</a>. I emphasize again
      the importance of choosing a good project name from the
      beginning.</li>

      <li><a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a>,
      <a href="http://perl.com/">Perl</a>,
      <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> scripting.</li>

      <li>MySQL database.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>You can of course use Eclipse to develop this content. For
    example, you may use the Eclipse Web Tools project to create your
    HTML content. There are also PHP authoring plug-ins.</p>

    <p>To publish your content, you must use SSH secure copy.
    You must login under a
    project's administrator id, which gives you write access to
    the web page space. Due to the large number of hosted projects,
    SourceForge uses a branching directory structure to make it
    easier to navigate and so that clients do not have to download
    extremely large directory listings. For example, my eclipseexeditor
    project is stored at
    <code>/home/groups/e/ec/eclipseexeditor</code>. I use WinSCP to
    copy files from my home computer to the SourceForge server. In this
    <a href="images/WinSCP.png">screenshot</a>, I drag a file
    from the Eclipse package explorer to WinSCP's folder
    representing my SourceForge-hosted project web space.</p>

    <p>Each project is required to
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docs/E07/en/#top">display the
    SourceForge logo</a> on their web pages hosted on the project web
    service. There are several logos available. You get the logo
    image from a special SourceForge URL that includes your project
    group id. The SourceForge server records a page hit for your project
    when a web browser displays the image. For example, the image URL
    <code>http://sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?group_id=137861&amp;type=1</code>
    counts as a web hit for my ETEE project with the group id 137861.
    Be sure to use the correct logo image URL so your project gets
    accurate web statistics.</p>

    <h4>Hosting an update site</h4>

    <p>You may wonder if you can use the SourceForge web hosting
    service to host an Eclipse Plug-in update site. There is little
    guidance on this that I know of. Some people report that this is
    frowned upon because SourceForge encourages the use of the File
    Release System (FRS) for hosting binaries. The FRS uses mirror
    sites around the world to support scalable download services for
    SourceForge projects. In addition, if you use the FRS, you get the
    benefits of download statistics that show download counts. Such
    download counts can raise your project's activity rating and
    add some momentum to your project. Nevertheless, you have the following
    alternative for your update site:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>If you want to host an update site on your project web site
      instead of using the FRS, you should ask the SourceForge
      administrators first. It may be bad etiquette to
      place binary files on the project web site &mdash; if overused, binary
      file downloads could affect web page hosting performance for all
      SourceForge projects. To deploy your update, you will just need
      to copy the site to your project web space.</li>

      <li>If you want to host an update site using the FRS, the
      procedure is a bit more complex. The FRS uses mirror sites, so
      you will need to design your update site so that it obtains files
      from one mirror only. In addition, the FRS is a flat structure
      with a single directory per project. Therefore any plug-in and feature
      you release must have a unique name &mdash; you cannot have a feature jar
      that has the same name as a plug-in jar.
      You then need to make a release for each feature
      and plug-in jars to the FRS. Then you need to create an enhanced
      site.xml file manually. You can find a good example
      <a href="http://eplug.sourceforge.net/site.xml">here</a> with
      some explanations at the bottom of the
      <a href="http://eplug.sourceforge.net/">eplug project home page</a>, which uses that approach.
      With a bit more
      work, it should even be possible to take advantage of the Sourceforge mirrors.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One additional option to consider is to bundle a full update
    site (the <code>site.xml</code> and jar files etc.) into an
    archive, and make that file part of your release. Then, users can
    download the update site and host it locally, for example on a
    local Eclipse update site on a corporate intranet. Since people
    will share binaries anyway, you can make it easier and help with
    wider adoption of your plug-in.</p>

    <p>Since an update site can manage multiple plug-ins versions, you
    should consider defining a separate SourceForge FRS
    'package' for your update site archive. If you simply
    include the update site (call it <code>update-site.zip</code> ) in
    the normal plug-in package, version 1.0 of
    <code>update-site.zip</code> will contain version 1.0 of your
    plug-in. Version 1.1 of <code>update-site.zip</code> will contain
    both 1.0 and 1.1 of your plug-in. Since SourceForge never deletes
    previous releases, this practice leads to a lot of unnecessary wasted
    server space and potential confusion. I find easier to maintain
    only one release of an update site package (with a release name of
    &quot;updates&quot; instead of a numbered release name). Then, each
    time you release a new version of the plug-in, simply replace the
    current <code>update-site.zip</code> &mdash; which contains whatever
    plug-in versions you wish &mdash; within that updated package's
    release.</p>

    <h4>Registering with a plug-in promotion site</h4>

    <p>Once you have your plug-in deployed via SFPDE, you need to tell
    the Eclipse community about it. In addition to the SourceForge
    Trove, you may wish to consider registering your Plug-in on one of
    several plug-in listing sites that you can find on the Eclipse.org
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/community/pluginsites.php">community
    page</a>.</p>

    <p>If one of these sites does not drive enough traffic to your
    plug-in, you can always write and publish an article about Eclipse
    and figure out an interesting way to plug your plug-in in your
    article!</p>

    <h3>Parting Thoughts</h3>

    <p>Explore all the services the '<strong>SourceForge Plug-in
    Development Environment</strong>' has to offer. Once you have created,
    configured, and populated your project site, refer to your
    project's Admin link and the on-line SourceForge documentation
    to learn how to:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Backup up your configuration</li>

      <li>Use the compile farm</li>

      <li>Choosing your support options</li>

      <li>Creating Mailman mailing lists and hosting web discussion
      forums</li>

    </ul>

    <p>You will find that SourceForge is a tremendous resource for open
    source development and the project management of Eclipse plug-ins
    development projects &mdash; a web hosting equivalent of the Eclipse
    desktop experience.
    Plug into SourceForge today and see your plug-in reap the myriad
    benefits SFPDE &mdash; SourceForge + Eclipse PDE &mdash; has to offer.</p>
