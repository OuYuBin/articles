		In the Eclipse Platform a view is typically used to navigate a
		hierarchy of information, open an editor, or display properties
		for the active editor. In this article the design and
		implementation of a view will be examined in detail. You'll
		learn how to create a simple view based on SWT, and a more
		advanced view using the JFace viewer hierarchy. We'll also look
		at ways to achieve good integration with many of the existing
		features in the workbench, such as the window menu and toolbar,
		view linking, workbench persistence and action extension.
