		Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) provides a powerful foundation
		for creating editors for visual editing of arbitrary models. Its
		effectiveness lies in a modular build, fitting use of design
		patterns, and decoupling of components that comprise a full,
		working editor. To a newcomer, the sheer number and variety of
		concepts and techniques present in GEF may feel intimidating.
		However, once learned and correctly used, they help to develop
		highly scalable and easy to maintain software. This article aims
		to provide a gentle yet comprehensive introduction to GEF. It
		describes a shape diagram editor - a small, fully functional
		test case of core concepts.
