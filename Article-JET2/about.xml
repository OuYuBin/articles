		In Part 2 of this JET (Java Emitter Templates) tutorial, we will
		take a look at the JET engine API. You will learn how to write
		plug-ins that use the classes in the JET package to generate
		Java source code.As a real-world example, we will create a
		plug-in that takes user input and generates a Typesafe
		Enumeration class. The generated source code is based on a JET
		template that can be distributed with the plug-in, allowing
		users of the plug-in to customize the generated code by editing
		the template. This article also provides a short reference to
		the JET API.
