		<![CDATA[Decorators, as the name suggests, are used for
		adorning/annotating resources with useful information.
		Decorators can be used by plug-ins to convey more information
		about a resource and other objects displayed in different
		workbench views. This article, with the help of a simple plug-in 
		example, will illustrate the steps involved in decorating resources, 
		along with some best practice approaches for decorating resources.
		Finally, we will discuss performance issues that may arise when
		enabling decorators, and briefly go over the new lightweight decorators
		found in Eclipse 2.1.
		<p>
			We assume the reader already has a basic understanding of
			Eclipse and knows how to create simple plug-ins.]]>
