		The JFace API provides several classes that can be used to build
		editable table views. In this article, we present a fairly
		extensive example that exercises the JFace and SWT classes
		needed to implement a table with cell editors for check-boxes,
		free text and combo-boxes. We also show how to package and
		deliver the classes into a stand-alone (non-Eclipse) Java
		application.
