<h2>
<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
In this document the Eclipse User Interface Guidelines are defined.
<p>Eclipse is a universal tool platform - an open, extensible IDE for anything,
but nothing in particular. The real value comes from tool plug-ins that
"teach" Eclipse how to work with things - Java&trade; files, Web content, graphics,
video - almost anything you can imagine. Eclipse allows you to independently
develop tools that integrate with other people's tools so seamlessly, you
won't know where one tool ends and another starts. The very notion of a
tool, as we know it, disappears completely.
<p>The platform is very flexible and extensible, but this flexibility has
a serious drawback.&nbsp; In particular, there is no way within the program
to ensure User Interface consistency between the registered components
within the platform.&nbsp; This document attempts to reconcile this problem,
by defining standard User Interface guidelines for the creation of new
components.&nbsp; If these guidelines are adopted within your own tools,
it will lead to greater consistency with the platform and other tools,
and an easier learning curve for your customers.
<p>These guidelines are intended for use by designers and implementors
of an Eclipse user interface extension.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="The Workbench"></a>The Workbench</h3>
To start out, let's take a look at the workbench user interface, and the
various components within it.
<p>The workbench is a collection of windows.&nbsp; Each window contains
a menu, a toolbar, and one or more perspectives (see below).&nbsp; A perspective
is a visual container for a set of views and editors (parts).&nbsp; These
parts exist wholly within the perspective and are not shared.&nbsp; A perspective
is like a page within
a book.&nbsp; It exists within a window along with any number of other
perspectives and, like a page within a book, only one perspective is visible
at any time.
<center>
<p><img SRC="workbench_decomposed.jpg" height=578 width=480></center>

<p>In the File menu you will find a New submenu, which contains menu items
for Project, Folder, and File creation.&nbsp; The File menu also contains
menu items for Import and Export, which are used to import files into the
Workbench, and export them out again.&nbsp; In the Edit menu, you will
find familiar actions like Cut, Copy, Paste, and Delete.&nbsp; These actions
are known as global actions, and target the active part (as indicated by
a shaded title bar). In other words, if the Delete action is invoked with
the Navigator active, the actual implementation is performed by the Navigator.
In the Perspective menu, you will find menu items to add views to the window,
or change the layout of the window completely.&nbsp; In the Window menu
you'll find the Preferences menu item, which is used to modify the functional
preferences of Eclipse.
<p>As a plug-in developer, you can contribute new views, editors, wizards,
menu, and tool items to the platform.&nbsp; These contributions are defined
using XML, and once registered, integrate seamlessly with the components
which already exist in the platform.
<h3>
<a NAME="Projects, Folder and Files"></a>Projects, Folder and Files</h3>
Eclipse can be used to create anything - java files, web content, graphics,
video - almost anything you can imagine.&nbsp; These objects are stored
as regular files within the Eclipse workspace.&nbsp; The workspace consists
of one or more top level projects.&nbsp; Each project contains a collection
of folders and files.&nbsp; These objects are known as <i>resources</i>.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>
<hr ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2>
For most developers, an introduction to the platform can be overwhelming,
and you may ask "where do I get started?".&nbsp; Here are a few basic guidelines
which will help you.
<p>This document is intended for UI developers.&nbsp; With this audience
in mind, we can talk about the two main layers of any application: the
model layer and the user interface layer.&nbsp; In Eclipse the model layer,
known as the Workspace, is a collection of resources (projects, folders
and files).&nbsp; The user interface, or Workbench, defines the presentation
for those resources.
<p>As a UI developer, you will also have a model and a presentation.&nbsp;
If we assume that your goal is to make the model visible, through some
presentation, most developers will start out by adding a new view or editor
to the workbench.
<p><font color="#000000">In Eclipse, an editor is used to interact with
the primary focus of attention, which may be a document, data object, or
person.&nbsp; In every case, the primary focus of attention is a reflection
of the primary task.&nbsp; To illustrate this concept, let's look at some
common examples.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">To do Java programming, the primary task is to
create, edit, and debug Java code. The primary focus is the Java code,
so an editor is used to interact with that code.&nbsp; The navigator, outline,
and properties view exist to support the primary task, but rarely hold
your attention for an extended period of time while you are writing Java
code.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">To read email, the primary task is to create,
send, read, and reply to email. The primary focus is a particular email
message, so an editor is used to view or reply to an email message.&nbsp;
A view may be used to select an email message to read, and open an editor.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">To communicate using instant messenging, the primary
task is the conversation.&nbsp; The primary focus is a particular conversation,
so an editor is used to carry on that conversation.&nbsp; A view may be
used to list people with whom you can initiate a conversation.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">To browse the Web, the primary task is reading.
The primary focus is a particular web page, so an editor is used to browse
the web page. A</font>
<br>
  <font color="#000000">view may be used to save your favorite links, and reopen 
  them.&nbsp; At any time, you may decide to edit the page you are looking at.&nbsp; 
  This causes a new</font> <font color="#000000">editor to open.</font> 
<p><font color="#000000">In each case, the primary task determines the primary 
  focus of attention. As the primary focus of attention, it deserves a primary 
  position in the UI</font> <font color="#000000">(as an editor), and can contribute 
  actions to the window menu bar and toolbar.</font> 
<p><font color="#000000">Views are used to support the primary task.&nbsp; You 
  use them to navigate a hierarchy of information, open an editor, or view properties 
  for the active</font> <font color="#000000">editor.&nbsp; In reflection of their 
  support role, they can not contribute actions to the window menu bar and toolbar.</font> 
<p>Once you have added a view or editor, an interesting question arises.&nbsp;
Where did this model come from?&nbsp; In Eclipse, most data is created
using a Creation Wizard.&nbsp; You may want to add a Creation wizard too.
And once an object exists, you may need a way to edit the properties for
that object using a Properties page, or the Properties dialog.
<p>All of these ideas will be discussed, in detail, in the following sections.

<h2>
<a NAME="General UI Guidelines"></a>General UI Guidelines</h2>

<hr ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="100%">
<br>This document defines UI guidelines that are unique and specific to
the Eclipse platform. It is a supplement to the other standard UI guidelines
such as Microsoft&reg; User Experience, Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines,
and Java Look and Feel Guidelines. You should continue to consult those
guidelines for basic UI design and implementation recommendations.
<p>It is expected that you already have a basic understanding of the Eclipse
UI architecture and APIs, and the basic UI design principles: user in control,
directness, consistency, forgiveness, feedback, aesthetics, and simplicity.
If you do not currently have the prerequisite knowledge, please read the
relevant documentation first.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">
Guideline 1.1</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Follow and apply good user interface
design principles: user in control, directness, consistency, forgiveness,
feedback, aesthetics, and simplicity.</font></blockquote>

<h3>
<a NAME="The Spirit of Eclipse"></a>The Spirit of Eclipse</h3>
At its heart, Eclipse is a platform for tool plug-ins.&nbsp; These plug-ins
may be developed by a single team or by a partnership of teams, or the
user may assemble a set of plug-ins from diverse sources.&nbsp; In either
case, the usability of an individual tool, and Eclipse as a whole, will
be positively influenced by user interface consistency.
<p>If you're in doubt about the appropriate look and feel for a tool, look
to the platform first, then the Java development tooling in Eclipse for
guidance. In many cases, the workflow you imagine may already exist in
Eclipse.&nbsp; If so, adopt the platform's workflow and user interface
conventions. This will lead to greater consistency with the platform and
other plugins, and an easier learning curve for your customers.
<p>In some scenarios, it may be tempting to ignore the workflow of Eclipse and 
  implement a "custom" user interface.&nbsp; This interface will almost certainly 
  stand out like a sore thumb in an integrated environment, where other tools 
  adopt the platform conventions.&nbsp; You lose the benefit of past experience, 
  and force your customers to learn new ideas. 
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">
Guideline 1.2</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Follow the platform lead for user interface
conventions.</font></blockquote>
If you decide to reuse the conventions of Eclipse, be careful not to misappropriate
Eclipse specific UI conventions.&nbsp; For instance, the active part in
a workbench window is indicated by a shaded title.&nbsp; The use of shaded
titles within an editor (see below) may be one way to indicate where the
focus is, within that part, but it will also blur the concept of part activation
in the window.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="badHilight.jpg" HSPACE=50 height=427 width=706>
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">
Guideline 1.3</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Be careful not to mix UI metaphors.&nbsp;
It may blur the original concept, and your own application.</font></blockquote>
Eclipse is an open source project.&nbsp; If you feel your ideas are generally
useful, join the Eclipse community, write a proposal, and work with the
Eclipse community to make Eclipse a better platform for product development
and customer satisfaction.
<p>Visit www.eclipse.org and join the Eclipse UI mailing list platform-ui-dev.

Guideline 1.4</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">If you have an interesting idea, work
with the Eclipse community to make Eclipse a better platform for all.</font></blockquote>

<h3>
<a NAME="Capitalization"></a>Capitalization</h3>
Consistent capitalization of text within a plug-in leads to a more polished
feel, and greater perception of quality.&nbsp; Within a dialog or window,
headline capitalization should be applied to all titles, menus, toolbar
items, tabs, and push buttons.&nbsp; Sentence style capitalization should
be applied to all check boxes, radio buttons, and group labels.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b> <font color="#3333FF">Guideline
1.5</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Use Headline style capitalization for
all titles, including those used for windows, dialogs, tabs, column headings
and push buttons. Capitalize the first and last words, and all nouns, pronouns,
adjectives, verbs and adverbs.&nbsp; Do not include ending punctuation.</font></blockquote>
<img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">
Guideline 1.6</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Use Sentence style capitalization for
all control labels in a dialog or window, including those for check boxes,
radio buttons, group labels, and simple text fields.&nbsp; Capitalize the
first letter of the first word, and any proper names.</font></blockquote>

<h3>
<a NAME="Colors"></a>Colors</h3>
Eclipse provides full support for indexed and true color display.&nbsp;
On paletted devices, true colors will be mapped to the appropriate palette
color using a best fit approach, so no work is required of the plug-in
developer to support these devices.&nbsp; Images associated with a menu
item, toolbar item, or control icon may be defined with 256 colors or greater.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="Language"></a>Language</h3>
Eclipse will ship on a variety of different platforms, in a variety of
locales.&nbsp; In reflection of the different languages and numeric formats
in each, a localization strategy should be adopted for the text and images
within each plug-in.&nbsp; This involves the separation of all resources
from the source code of a plug-in itself, so that those resources can be
translated to a new locale.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">
Guideline 1.7</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Localize the resources within your plug-in.</font></blockquote>

<h3>
<a NAME="Error Handling"></a>Error Handling</h3>
If an error occurs in Eclipse, the appropriate response will be dependent
on the context of the error.
<p>When a user input error occurs in a wizard, please refer to <a href="#Wizards">Wizards</a>
section on how to handle the error.
<p>When an error occurs in an editor, please refer to <a href="#Editors">Editors</a>
section on how to handle the error.
<p>When an error occurs which requires either an explicit user input or
immediate attention from users, a modal dialog should be used to communicate
the error to the user.&nbsp; This forces the user to notice, and deal with
the problem. It is not appropriate to activate a part and display the error
in the part.&nbsp; If this approach is taken, the user may fail to notice
the activation and the error.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
1.8</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">When an error occurs which requires either
an explicit user input or immediate attention from users, communicate the
occurrence with a modal dialog.</font></blockquote>
If a programming error occurs in the product, an error dialog should be
used to communicate the occurrence to the user.&nbsp; The error should
also be logged using the workbench error logging facility.&nbsp; This gives
the user an opportunity to restart the platform, remove the offending plugin,
and contact their system administrator.
<p>The plug-in should provide the following information in the detail area
of the error dialog:
<ul>
<li>
Provider name</li>

<li>
Plug-in name (user friendly name)</li>

<li>
Plug-in ID</li>

<li>
Version</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="Actions"></a>Actions</h3>
An <i>action</i> is a command which can be triggered by the user.&nbsp;
An action may appear as an item in a menu, or an item in a toolbar.&nbsp;
In reflection of this, it has attributes for the menu or tool item label,
tooltip, and image.
<p>As a plug-in developer, you can contribute actions to the window menu
bar and toolbar, or to individual views and editors.&nbsp; Contribution
to the window is performed using an <i>action set</i>, a set of task oriented
actions which the user can show or hide.&nbsp; Contribution to a view or
editor is performed using individual actions.
<p>Here is an illustration of the main areas of contribution.
<p><img SRC="actionExamples.jpg" HSPACE=50 height=562 width=474>
<p>In this section we'll look at general action guidelines.&nbsp; For information
on window, view, or editor specific guidelines, see <a href="#Windows">Windows</a>,
<a href="#Views">Views</a>,
and <a href="#Editors">Editors</a>.
<h4>
Appearance</h4>
Each action must have a label, tool tip, and image.&nbsp; If the action
appears in a toolbar, the action image will be displayed on all platforms.&nbsp;
If the action appears in a menu, the image will only be displayed on some
platforms, such as Windows&reg; 2000.&nbsp; The label and tool tip should use
Headline style capitalization, as defined in General UI Guidelines.
<p>Each action must provide one full color image.&nbsp; This image will
be displayed if the mouse is placed over the action.&nbsp; It will also
be used to generate the enabled, disabled, and pressed images which appear
in normal action use.&nbsp; Actions which are contributed in code also
have the option to define explicit images for enabled, disabled, and roll
over.&nbsp; This option can be used for greater control over image appearance.
<p>The following snapshot shows the valid use of Headline capitalization
in a toolbar.
<p><img SRC="tooltipCaps.jpg" height=141 width=244>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
2.1</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Each action must have a label, tool tip,
and full color image.&nbsp; The label and tool tip must use Headline style
capitalization.</font></blockquote>
The tool tips for an action should describe the <i>behavior which occurs</i>
if the action is invoked.&nbsp; For instance, in the following snapshot
the behavior of the Field button is shown.&nbsp; If the action is unpressed,
pressing the action will hide the fields.&nbsp; If the action is pressed,
unpressing the action will show the fields.&nbsp; This behavior is shown
using two tool tips.
<p><img SRC="goodTooltips.jpg" height=203 width=437>
<p>A single tool tip should not be used to convey the behavior of both
cases.&nbsp; It is too ambiguous.
<p><img SRC="badTooltips.jpg" height=116 width=640>
<p>Nor should it label the state the toolbar button is currently in.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
2.2</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">The action tooltip should describe the
result of the action, not the current state of the action.</font></blockquote>
For consistency, any action which has a similar behavior to existing actions
in the workbench, should adopt the same terminology.
<p>When creating a resource, the term "New" should be used in an action
or wizard.&nbsp; For instance, "New File", "New Project" and "New Java
Class".&nbsp; The term "Delete" should be used when deleting an existing
resource.
<p>When creating an object inside a resource (e.g., a tag in an XML file;
a method or field in a Java class), the term "Add" should be used; the
user is adding something to an existing resource.&nbsp; The term "Remove"
should be used to remove an object from a resource.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
2.3</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Adopt the labeling terminology of the
workbench for New, Delete, Add, and Remove actions.</font></blockquote>

<h4>
Enablement</h4>
An action should only be enabled if it can be completed successfully.&nbsp;
If this is not the case, the action should be disabled.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
2.4</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">An action should only be enabled if it
can be completed successfully.</font></blockquote>
Action enablement should be quick to calculate.&nbsp; If it is too expensive
to calculate the enablement of an action, the action should be optimistically
enabled.&nbsp; If the action is invoked, it should calculate the real enablement,
and show a dialog to the user if it is not available.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
2.5</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Action enablement should be quick.&nbsp;
If action enablement cannot be quick, enable the action optimistically
and display an appropriate message if the action is invoked, but cannot
be completed.</font></blockquote>

<hr ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="100%">
<h3>
<a NAME="Dialogs"></a>Dialogs</h3>
A dialog is used for modal interaction with the user.&nbsp; It can be used
to solicit information, or provide feedback.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Initialization</h4>
When a dialog first opens, the initial focus should be given to the first
control where information is required from the user.&nbsp; This control
can be determined by the tab order of controls until a control is found
where information is required.&nbsp; If the dialog provides simple feedback,
or requires simple confirmation from the user, the initial focus may also
be assigned to the default button.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">

<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">When a dialog opens, set the initial
focus to one of the controls in the container.</font></blockquote>

<h4>
Multiple Item Selection</h4>
Slush Bucket widgets (also known as the Twin Box design) should flow from
the left to the right with the source objects on the left and selected
files on the right.
<p>Slush Buckets should also have the following control buttons, in this
order, for moving objects from the source the selected buckets.

<h3>
<a NAME="Wizards"></a>Wizards</h3>
In Eclipse, a wizard is commonly used for the creation of new resources,
resource import, or resource export.&nbsp; It can also be used for the
execution of any task involving a sequential series of steps.&nbsp; A wizard
should be used if there are many steps in the task, and they must be completed
in a specific order.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
4.1</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Use a wizard for any task consisting
of many steps, which must be completed in a specific order.</font></blockquote>

<h4>
Appearance</h4>
At the top of each wizard is a header, containing a banner graphic and
a text area.&nbsp; The banner graphic contains an image representing the
wizard task, and should be created with a white to blue, gray scale palette
for consistency with other banners in Eclipse.&nbsp; These colors also
avoid distracting the user from the important fields of the wizard.&nbsp;
The text area is used to prompt the user for information which is absent,
and display error messages if information is invalid.&nbsp; The presence
of the header, with banner graphic and text area, creates a more polished
feel, and greater perception of quality to the wizard.
<p>At the bottom of each wizard, a Back, Next, Finish, and Cancel button
should appear.
<p><img SRC="wizardAppearance.jpg" HSPACE=40 height=390 width=500>
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline

<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Each wizard must contain a header with
a banner graphic and a text area for user feedback.&nbsp; It must also
contain Back, Next, Finish, and Cancel buttons in the footer.</font></blockquote>

<h4>
Initialization</h4>
When a wizard first opens, the focus should be placed in the first field
requiring information (see Guidelines 3.1).&nbsp; The header should be
used to prompt the user for the first piece of required information.
<p><img SRC="goodWizardInit.jpg" height=122 width=570>
<p>It is not appropriate to display an error message.&nbsp; At this point,
the user hasn't done anything yet.

4.3</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Start the wizard with a prompt, not an
error message.</font></blockquote>
The initial state of the wizard should be derived from the context where
it is opened.&nbsp; For instance, in the New File wizard, the current workbench
selection is examined.&nbsp; If it points to a valid project or folder,
the wizard will pre-populate the parent field with the parent project or
folder name, and put cursor focus in the next field requiring user input.&nbsp;
If the user's selection does not point to a valid parent project or folder,
the wizard will not pre-populate the folder name. Instead, it will leave
the field blank and put the cursor focus in the field.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
the user's selection is on a file, a wizard may also go through these calculations
using the parent folder or project of the file.

4.4</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Seed the fields within the wizard using
the current workbench state.</font></blockquote>

<h4>
Validation of Data</h4>
Information validation within a wizard should be done in tab order.&nbsp;
If the first required field is empty, an informative prompt should be shown
in the text area, directing the user to fill in the field.&nbsp; If the
first required field is in error, an error message should be shown in the
text area.&nbsp; If the first required field is valid, check the next field,
and so on.&nbsp; The text area should not be used to display more than
one prompt or error at a time.
<p>If dialog information is absent or invalid, the Next or Finish buttons
should be disabled until the situation is resolved.&nbsp; When resolution
occurs, and all of the information has been provided, the Next or Finish
buttons may be enabled.
<p><img SRC="wizardErrorMsgs.jpg" height=527 width=540>
<p>Error messages should only be displayed when user input is invalid.

<h4>
Browse Buttons</h4>
An edit field and "Browse..." button combination should be used whenever
an existing object is referenced within a wizard.&nbsp; The edit field
is used for direct input of the existing object, and the Browse button
is used to browse and select the object from a list of all possible choices.
<p>For instance, in the New Java Class wizard, a "Browse..." button is
placed beside the "Super Class" edit field.&nbsp; If the browse button
is pressed, a Browse Dialog will appear, and the user can select a super
class.&nbsp; This pattern should be used whenever a link will be established
between a new object and an old one.&nbsp; The "Browse..." button should
be located to the right of the edit field.

<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Use a Browse Button whenever an existing

In the Browse Dialog, invalid choices should not appear.&nbsp; When the
dialog is closed, and focus returns to the parent control, refresh the
enablement state of controls within the dialog.&nbsp; In particular, refresh
the enablement of Next, Finish, and OK buttons.

<h4>
Wizard Completion</h4>
The New Resource and Import Wizards commonly create new files, folders,
and projects within the workbench.&nbsp; If a single file is created, the
wizard should open the file in an editor in the active page.&nbsp; If more
than one file is created, open the most important, or central file.&nbsp;
This makes it easier to modify and save the file.
<p>Have a readme.html file for every example project, and opening that
readme.html automatically upon project creation.&nbsp; This will give users
an immediate overview of the example: what it does, prerequisites, limitations,
steps to take, and so on.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline

<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">If a new file is created, open the file
in an editor.&nbsp; If a group of files are created, open the most important,
or central file in an editor. Open the readme.html file upon creation of
an example project.</font></blockquote>
If a new project is created, the wizard should change the active perspective
within the workbench to one which is appropriate for the new project type.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
4.10</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">If a new project is created, change the
active perspective to suit the project type.</font></blockquote>
In either case, where a file, folder, or project is created, the wizard
should select and reveal the new object in the appropriate view.&nbsp;
This provides concrete evidence to the user that, yes, the new object was
created and now exists.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
4.11</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">If a new object is created, select and
reveal the new object in the appropriate view.</font></blockquote>
In many situations, the creation of a resource may involve the creation
of a project or folder to contain the resource.&nbsp; If the containing
project or folder can be created from within the wizard (with a very reasonable
set of defaults), the wizard should allow it. If the creation of such resources
requires detailed user interaction in order for parent project or folder
to be set up correctly, the wizard should not attempt to do this. Instead,
the wizard error text should instruct the user that "The specified project
does not exist".
<p>The EAR Import wizard is an example where allowing the user to specify
the name of the parent project in place makes for a much more usable interaction.
In this case, based on the user provided name, the wizard goes off and
creates not only the EAR project itself, but also any web projects, etc.,
that may be needed as well.

<h4>
Terminology</h4>
Within a creation wizard, if the item being created must be a Project (not
a folder below a project) the label "Project Name" should be used to receive
the project name.&nbsp; If it can be a folder below the project, the term
"Folder" should be used.&nbsp; Do not qualify the term (e.g., do not use
"Server Folder").

An editor is a visual component within a workbench page. It is <font color="#000000">used
to interact with the primary focus of attention, which may be a document,
data object, or person.&nbsp; The primary focus of attention is a reflection
of the primary task.</font>

5.1</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Use a editor to edit or browse a file,
document, or other input object.</font></blockquote>
Modifications made in an editor follow an open-save-close lifecycle model.&nbsp;
When an editor first opens, the editor contents should be unmodified (clean).&nbsp;
If the contents are modified, the editor should communicate this change
to the platform.&nbsp; In response, an asterisk will appear in the editor
tab.&nbsp; The modifications should be buffered within the edit model,
until such a time as the user explicitly saves them.&nbsp; At that point,
the modifications should be committed to the model storage.

An editor is document or input-centric.&nbsp; Each editor has an input,
and only one editor can exist for each editor input within a page.&nbsp;
This policy has been designed to simplify part management.

<h4>
Appearance</h4>
The editor should be labeled with the name of the resource being edited;
not with the name of the editor.

plugin file and html editors.
<p>Tab labels should be kept to one word, and two words at most.

The window menu bar contains a number of global actions, such as Cut, Copy,

<h4>
Toolbars</h4>
An editor may contribute actions directly to the window toolbar.&nbsp;
The toolbar is used to expose the most commonly used actions in an editor.&nbsp;
Any action which appears in the toolbar must also appear in the menu, but
there is no need to duplicate every action in the menu within the toolbar.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
5.10</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Fill the editor toolbar with the most
commonly used items in the view menu.</font></blockquote>
The use of a local toolbar within an editor is contrary to the design of
the workbench.&nbsp; Within the workbench, the toolbar for an editor is
shared with editors of the same type.&nbsp; This reduces the flash which
occurs when you switch between editors, reduces the number of images and
actions in the product, and creates a better feel of integration.
<h4>
Context Menus</h4>
A context menu should be used for context sensitive interaction with the
objects in an editor.&nbsp; If an object is selected in an editor, and
the context menu is opened, the context menu should only contain actions
which are appropriate for the selection.&nbsp; Actions which affect the
presentation of the view should not appear in the context menu.
<p>In a text editor, you may assume that there is only one type of selection:
text.&nbsp; In this case, the contents of the context menu will remain
consistent for any selection in the editor.

5.11</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Fill the context menu with selection
oriented actions, do not presentation or global actions.</font></blockquote>
For consistency with other editors in Eclipse, each editor should adopt
a common order for actions within the context menu.&nbsp; This format is
shown in the following table.&nbsp; Within this table, each item represents
a category of actions.&nbsp; The categories within the context menu should
be kept distinct from one another through the use of separators.

<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Use the standard format for editor context
menus.</font></blockquote>
For good spatial navigation, fill the context menu with a fixed set of
actions for each selection type.&nbsp; Once the contents have been defined,
the enablement state of each action should determined using the selected
object state.&nbsp; In doing so, you establish a consistency which makes
the menu more predictable, and easier to navigate.

One of the primary goals for the platform UI is extensibility.&nbsp; In
fact, it is this extensibility which gives you the freedom to add new views,
editors, perspectives, and actions to the platform.&nbsp; Of course, extensibility
is a two way street.&nbsp; While you may wish to extend the platform, others
may wish to extend your view or editor.&nbsp; It is common for one plug-in
to add actions to the menu, toolbar, or context menu of an editor from
another plugin.
<p>In the platform, the menu and toolbar for an editor are automatically extended 
  by the platform.&nbsp; In contrast, context menu extension is supported in collaboration 
  between the editor and the platform.&nbsp; To achieve this collaboration, an 
  editor must register each context menu it contains with the platform.&nbsp; 
  It should also define an action filter for each object type in the editor.&nbsp; 
  An action filter makes it easier for one plug-in to add an action to objects 
  in an editor defined by another plug-in.&nbsp; The target is described using 
  object type and attributes.&nbsp;&nbsp; For more information on the implementation 
  of this concept, refer to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/viewArticle/ViewArticle2.html" target="_top">Creating 
  an Eclipse View.</a>

<h4>
Resource Deletion</h4>
When a resource is deleted from one of the navigators (e.g., Navigator
view, J2EE view, Data view, or DBA Explorer view), the handling of any
editor that is currently open on that resource should be dependent on the
change state of the editor.
<p>If the editor does not contain any changes since the resource was last
saved then the editor should be immediately closed.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
5.16</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">If the input to an editor is deleted,
and the editor contains no changes, the editor should be closed.</font></blockquote>
If the editor contains changes to the resource since the resource was last
saved (i.e., it is "dirty"), the editor should give the user a chance to
save their changes to another location, and then close.&nbsp; Here is a
sample of the dialog which should be displayed:
<p><img SRC="fileDeletedDialog.jpg" HSPACE=50 height=124 width=436>
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline

<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">If the input to an editor is deleted,
and the editor contains changes, the editor should give the user a chance
to save their changes to another location, and then close.</font></blockquote>

<h4>
Unsaved Changes</h4>
If the editor contains changes to the resource since the resource was last
saved (i.e., it is "dirty"), an asterisk should be used to prefix the resource 
name presented in the editor tab:
<p><img SRC="dirtyEditor.jpg" HSPACE=50 height=331 width=334>

5.18</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">If the resource is dirty, prefix the resource 
name presented in the editor tab with an asterisk.</font></blockquote>

<h4>
Read Only Files</h4>
With a name like "editor", it's not surprising that the issue of read-only
files may cause confusion.&nbsp; If it's read-only, how can you edit it?&nbsp;
In this case, you should fall back to first principles.
<blockquote>A view is typically used to navigate a hierarchy of information,
open an editor, or display properties for the active editor.&nbsp; An editor
is typically used to edit or browse a file, document or other input object.</blockquote>
This statement is appropriate whether a file is read-only or not.&nbsp;
In either case, the user should be able to select the file, open it, and
browse the contents within an editor. If the file is read-only, the File
> Save action should be disabled and the File > Save As should be enabled.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
5.19</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Treat read-only editor input as you would
any other input.&nbsp; Enable the Save As if possible.</font></blockquote>

<h4>
Integration with Other Views</h4>
In Eclipse, there is a special relationship between each editor and the
Outline view.&nbsp; When an editor is opened, the Outline view will connect
to the editor, and ask it for an outline model.&nbsp; If the editor answers
an outline model, that model will be displayed in the Outline view whenever
the editor is active.&nbsp; The outline is used to navigate through the
edit data, or interact with the edit data at a higher level of abstraction.
<p>For instance, if you open a .java file in an editor, the structure of
the class is displayed in the Outline view.&nbsp; If you select a method
or field in the outline, the text declaration of that item will be selected
and revealed in the editor.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you select a method or field,
and open the context menu, you can interact with the item as a conceptual
unit, rather than just a bunch of text.
<p>In general, an editor should provide an outline model to the Outline
view if the data within the editor is too extensive to see on a single
screen, and will yield a structured outline.&nbsp; This structured outline
makes it very easy to navigate through objects like a java file or html
file.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
5.20</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">If the data within an editor is too extensive
to see on a single screen, and will yield a structured outline, the editor
should provide an outline model to the Outline view.</font></blockquote>

<p><br>When an Editor has an interaction with the Outline view, notification
about location should be two-way. That is, the user should be able to select
something in the outline and have the editor position updated, and the
user should be able to select something in the Editor pane and have the
outline view updated.
<p>Context&nbsp; menu should be available, as appropriate, in the outline
view which should support creation operations as appropriate.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
5.21</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Notification about location between an
Editor and the Outline view should be two-way. Context menu should be available
in the Outline view as appropriate.</font></blockquote>

<p><br>If the edit model contains errors or warnings, they should be indicated
in the Outline view.&nbsp; An error or warning image should be added to
the item with the error or warning respectively.&nbsp; If the item is part
of a tree, the error or warning image should also be propagated to each
ancestor of the item. If the ancestor of the item doesn't contain errors
or warnings, a different error or warning image -- for example, a grayed
X icon for error -- should be used for the ancestor. For instance, in the
following line, the addFastView method has an error, so an error image
is added to the item and its parent.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="errorsInOutline.jpg" HSPACE=50 height=284 width=223>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>For this to work, care must be taken to design icons with overlay in
mind, so that glyphs can be applied to the ancestor's icon.

In an editor, task objects are commonly used to mark a location within
a document.&nbsp; Once a task has been created, it appears in the Task
view.&nbsp; If the task is selected, you may reopen the editor at the location
defined in the Task.

<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">If appropriate, implement the "Add Task"
feature in your editor.</font></blockquote>

If the bookmark is selected, you may reopen the editor at the location
defined in the Task.

<h4>
Line Numbers</h4>
Editors with source lines of text should have line numbers, and optionally
column numbers.&nbsp; Editors should also support a Goto Line feature
available in the context menu allowing users to quickly jump to a desired
line.&nbsp; This functionality should be implemented along with line numbering
in the editor.

<h4>
Table Cell Editors</h4>
A single-click over a cell should select the current item and put the cell
into edit mode. In edit mode, any dropdowns, buttons, or other controls
in the cell should be rendered upon the single-click.
<br>&nbsp;

<p><br>In addition, changes should be committed once a user clicks off
the cell or hits ENTER.

<h4>
Error Notification</h4>
If you are doing keystroke by keystroke validation in an Editor, put error

<h4>
Interaction With External Editors</h4>
While a resource is opened within the workbench, if modifications are made
to it outside of the workbench, we recommend the following approach to
handle this situation. When the Save action is invoked in the editor, users
should be prompted to either override the changes made outside of the workbench,
or back out of the Save operation.

<a NAME="Views"></a>Views</h3>
A view is a visual component within a workbench page.&nbsp; It is<font color="#000000">
used in a support role for the primary task.&nbsp; You use them to navigate
a hierarchy of information, open an editor, or view properties for the
active editor.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
6.1</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Use a view to navigate a hierarchy of
information, open an editor, or display the properties of an object.</font></blockquote>
Modifications made in a view should be saved immediately.&nbsp; For instance,
if a file is modified in the Navigator, the changes are committed to the
workspace immediately.&nbsp; A change made in the Outline view is committed
to the edit model of the active editor immediately.&nbsp; For changes made
in the Properties view, if the property is a property of an open edit model,
it should be persisted to the edit model. If it is a property of a file,
persist to file.
<p>In the past, some views have tried to implement an editor style lifecycle,
with a Save action.&nbsp; This can cause confusion.&nbsp; The File menu
within a workbench window contains a Save action, but it only applies to
the active editor.&nbsp; It will not target the active view.&nbsp; This
leads to a situation where the File > Save action is in contradiction to
the Save action within the view.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
6.2</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Modifications made within a view must
be saved immediately.</font></blockquote>
Within a perspective, only one instance of a particular view can be opened.&nbsp;
This policy is designed to simplify part management for a user.&nbsp; The
user opens a view by invoking Perspective > Show View.&nbsp; If, for any
reason, they lose a view, or forget about its existence, they can simply
invoke Perspective > Show view again to make the view visible.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
6.3</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Only one instance of a view may exist
in a perspective.</font></blockquote>
In a multi-tasking world, humans often perform more than one task at a
time.&nbsp; In Eclipse, task separation can be achieved by creating a separate
perspective for each task.&nbsp; In reflection of this, it should be possible
to open a particular view in more than one perspective.&nbsp; If only one
instance of a view may exist, the ability to multi-task is taken away.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
6.4</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">A view must be opened in one or more
perspectives.</font></blockquote>
A view can be opened in two ways: by invoking Perspective > Show View >
X menu, where X is the name of the view, or by invoking another action
within the workbench.&nbsp; For instance, if you select a class in the
Packages view, and invoke Open Type Hierarchy, a Hierarchy view opens with
the class hierarchy for the selection.
<p>It should be possible to open any view from the Perspective > Show View
menu, either as an explicit item within the menu, or as an item within
the Perspective > Show View > Other dialog.

6.5</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">A view can be opened from the Perspective
> Show View menu.</font></blockquote>

<h4>
Appearance</h4>
A view consists of a title area, a toolbar, a pulldown menu, and an embedded
control.
<p>The view label in the title bar must be prefixed with label of the view
in Perspective > Show View menu.&nbsp; Given that it is impossible to change
the entry in the Show View menu, this means you cannot change the name
of a view.&nbsp; However, you can add additional text to the view label,
to clarify the state of the view.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
6.6</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">The view label in the title bar must
be prefixed with the label of the view in the Perspective > Show View menu.</font></blockquote>
In most cases, a view will contain a single control or viewer.&nbsp; However,
it is possible to embed more than one viewer or control in the view.&nbsp;
If these controls are linked, such that selection in one control changes
the input of another, it may be better to separate the view into two. Users
will have greater freedom to open one of the results views, as their needs
arise. Special relationships can alos be set up between these views to
support the user task. In addition, this makes it easier for users to create
a new perspective with a diverse set of views.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
6.7</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">If a view contains more than one control,
it may be advisable to split it up into two or more views.</font></blockquote>

<h4>
Initialization</h4>
When a view is opened, the input of the view should be derived from the
state of the perspective.&nbsp; The view may consult the perspective input
or selection, or the state of another view.&nbsp; For instance, if the
Outline view is opened, it will determine the active editor, query the
editor for an outline model, and display the outline model.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
6.8</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">When a view first opens, derive the view
input from the state of the perspective.</font></blockquote>
If the view is used to navigate a hierarchy of resources (i.e., the Navigator
or Packages view), the input of the view may be derived from the perspective
input.&nbsp; The perspective input defines the scope of visible resources
within the perspective, and is defined by the user if they select a resource
in the Navigator and invoke Open Perspective.&nbsp; For instance, if the
Navigator view is opened, it will ask its perspective for the perspective
input.&nbsp; The result is used as the initial input for the view.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
6.9</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">If a view displays a resource tree, consider
using the perspective input as the root of visible information in the view.</font></blockquote>

<h4>
Menus</h4>
The pulldown menu for a view should be used for presentation actions.&nbsp;
These are actions which affect the presentation of the view, but not the
objects within the view.&nbsp; For instance, the Sort and Filter actions
within the Navigator view affect the presentation of resources, but do
not affect the resources themselves.

6.10</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Fill the view pulldown menu with presentation
actions, not selection oriented actions.</font></blockquote>
For consistency with other views in Eclipse, each view should adopt a common
order for actions within the pulldown menu.&nbsp; This format is shown
in the following table.
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="200" >

<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Use the standard format for view pulldown
menus.</font></blockquote>

<h4>
Toolbars</h4>
The toolbar is used to expose the most commonly used actions in a view.&nbsp;
Any action which appears in the toolbar must also appear in the menu, but
there is no need to duplicate every action in the menu within the toolbar.

<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Fill the view toolbar with the most commonly
used items in the view menu.</font></blockquote>

<h4>
Context Menus</h4>
A context menu should be used for context sensitive interaction with the
objects in a view.&nbsp; If an object is selected in a view, and the context
menu is opened, the context menu should only contain actions which are
appropriate for the selection.&nbsp; Actions which affect the presentation
of the view should not appear in the context menu.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
6.13</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Fill the context menu with selection
oriented actions, not presentation actions.</font></blockquote>
For consistency with other views in Eclipse, each view should adopt a common
order for actions within the context menu.&nbsp; This format is shown in
the following table.&nbsp; Within this table, each item represents a category
of actions.&nbsp; The categories within the context menu should be kept
distinct from one another through the use of separators.
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER COLS=1 WIDTH="200" >

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Navigate + Show In</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Cut Copy Paste</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Delete</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Other Plugin Additions</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Properties</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>The New category contains actions which create new objects.&nbsp; The
Open category contains actions which open the selection in an editor.&nbsp;
Navigate contains actions to refocus the view input, or reveal the view
selection in another view.&nbsp; And the other categories are self explanatory.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
6.14</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Use the standard format for view context
menus.</font></blockquote>
For good spatial navigation, fill the context menu with a fixed set of
actions for each selection type.&nbsp; Once the contents have been defined,
the enablement state of each action should determined using the selected
object state.&nbsp; In doing so, you establish a consistency which makes
the menu more predictable, and easier to navigate.
<br>&nbsp;

6.15</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Fill the context menu with a fixed set
of actions for each selection type, and then enable or disable each to
reflect the selection state.</font></blockquote>
An object in one view may be visible in many other views or editors.&nbsp;
For instance, a .java file is visible in the Navigator, the Hierarchy view,
and the Packages view.&nbsp; To the user, these objects are all the same,
regardless of location, so the context menu for the .java file should be
the same in each.
<p>To achieve a consistent context menu, plug-in developers which introduce
a new object type should contribute actions to the context menu using an
action factory, a Java class which populates the context menu.&nbsp; If
this approach is used, the factory can be reused by other views where the
same objects appear.

6.16</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">If an object appears in more than one
view, it should have the same context menu in each.</font></blockquote>
One of the primary goals for the platform UI is extensibility.&nbsp; In
fact, it is this extensibility which gives you the freedom to add new views,
editors, perspectives, and actions to the platform.&nbsp; Of course, extensibility
is a two way street.&nbsp; While you may wish to extend the platform, others
may wish to extend your view or editor.&nbsp; It is common for one plug-in
to add actions to the menu, toolbar, or context menu of a view from another
plugin.
<p>In the platform, the menu and toolbar for a view are automatically extended 
  by the platform.&nbsp; In contrast, context menu extension is supported in collaboration 
  between the view and the platform.&nbsp; To achieve this collaboration, a view 
  must register each context menu it contains with the platform.&nbsp; It should 
  also define an action filter for each object type in the view.&nbsp; An action 
  filter makes it easier for one plug-in to add an action to objects in a view 
  defined by another plug-in.&nbsp; The action target is described using object 
  type and attributes.&nbsp;&nbsp; For more information on the implementation 
  of this concept, refer to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/viewArticle/ViewArticle2.html" target="_top">Creating

<h4>
Integration with the Window Menu Bar and Toolbar</h4>
The window menu bar contains a number of global actions, such as Cut, Copy,
and Paste within the Edit menu.&nbsp; These actions target the active part,
as indicated by a shaded title area.&nbsp; If these actions are supported
within a view, the view should hook these window actions, so that selection
in the window menu bar or toolbar produces the same result as selection
of the same action in the view.
<p>A complete list of the global actions is declared in the IWorkbenchActionConstants.java
(see below).
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /**</tt>

<h4>
Persistence</h4>
One of the primary goals for the platform UI is to provide efficient interaction
with the workspace.&nbsp; In the platform this is promoted by saving the
state of the workbench when a session (the workbench is shut down) ends.&nbsp;
When a new session (the workbench is opened) is started, this state is
restored, reducing the time required for the user to get back to work.
<p>If a view has a static input object, in the sense that its input is not derived 
  from selection in other parts, the state of the view should be persisted between 
  sessions. If a view has a dynamic or transient input object, there is no need 
  to persist its state between sessions. Within the workbench, the state of the 
  Navigator view, including the input and expansion state, is saved between sessions.

<h3>
<a NAME="Perspectives"></a>Perspectives</h3>
A perspective is a visual container for a set of views and editors (parts).&nbsp;
These parts exist wholly within the perspective and are not shared.&nbsp;
A perspective is like
a page within a book.&nbsp; It exists within a window along with any number
of other perspectives and, like a page within a book, only one perspective
is visible at any time.
<p>A new perspective is opened by invoking Perspective > Open > X, where
X identifies a particular perspective in Eclipse.&nbsp; The result is a
new perspective in the workbench window with <i>type</i> X.&nbsp; For instance,
if you invoke Perspective > Open > Resource, a new perspective is opened
with type <i>Resource</i>.&nbsp; Eclipse comes with a pre-defined number
of perspective types, including Resource, Java, and Team.&nbsp; The perspective
type determines the initial layout of views, and visibility of action sets
within the perspective.
<p>As a plug-in developer, you may contribute new perspective types to Eclipse.&nbsp; 
  To do this, you must define a perspective extension.&nbsp; Each extension has 
  a <i>perspective factory</i>, a Java class which defines the initial layout 
  of views, and visibility of action sets within the perspective.&nbsp; You can 
  also add your own actions or views to an existing perspective type.&nbsp; For 
  more information on the implementation of these concepts, see <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/using-perspectives/PerspectiveArticle.html" target="_top">Using 
  Perspectives in the Eclipse UI</a>. 
<p>A new perspective type should be created when there is a group of related
tasks which would benefit from a predefined configuration of actions and
views, and these tasks are long lived.&nbsp; A task oriented approach is
imperative.&nbsp; As a development environment, Eclipse was designed to
fulfill the needs of a large product development team, from product manager
to content developer to product tester.&nbsp; It is fully extensible and
may be configured with hundreds of action, wizard, view and editor extensions.&nbsp;
In other words, it may contain a lot of junk you'll never use.&nbsp; To
avoid the visual overload and confusion which would occur if everything
was visible in the UI, a perspective can be used to define together a task
oriented set of views and action sets.
<p>For instance, the task of Java code creation is long lived and complex,
so the creation of a Java perspective is warranted.&nbsp; In Eclipse, the
Java perspective contains an editor area, Packages view, Hierarchy view,
Tasks view, and Outline view.&nbsp; The Java and Debug action sets are
also visible.&nbsp; Together, these components are useful for a variety
of long lived, Java coding tasks.
<p>It is not appropriate to create a new perspective type for short lived
tasks.&nbsp; For instance, the task of resource check-in is short lived,
so it may be better performed using a view in the current perspective.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
7.1</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Create a new perspective type for long
lived tasks, which involve the performance of smaller, non modal tasks.</font></blockquote>
If your plug-in contributes a small number of views, and these augment
an existing task, it is better to add those views to an existing perspective.&nbsp;
For instance, if you create a view which augments the task of Java code
creation, don't create a new perspective.&nbsp; Instead, add it to the
existing Java perspective.&nbsp; This strategy provides better integration
with the existing platform.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
7.2</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">If you just want to expose a single view,
or two, extend an existing perspective type.</font></blockquote>

<h4>
View Layout</h4>
If the user opens a new perspective, the initial layout of views will be
defined by the perspective type (i.e., Resource, Java, Team).&nbsp; This
layout is performed in the <i>perspective factory</i>, a Java class associated
with the perspective type.&nbsp; When the perspective is initialized, it
consists of an editor area with no additional views.&nbsp; The perspective
factory may add new views, using the editor area as the initial point of
reference.
<p>The size and position of each view is controlled by the perspective
factory.&nbsp;&nbsp; These attributes should be defined in a reasonable
manner, such that the user can resize or move a view if they desire it.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
7.3</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">The size and position of each view in
a perspective should be defined in a reasonable manner, such that the user
can resize or move a view if they desire it.</font></blockquote>
A perspective should have at least two parts, including the visible views
and the editor area.&nbsp; If this is not the case, then the perspective
should be re-examined to determine if it is better suited as a view or
editor.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
7.4&nbsp;</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">If a perspective has just one part, it
may be better suited as a view or editor.</font></blockquote>
In some scenarios, it may be undesirable to have an editor area within
a perspective.&nbsp; In this case, the perspective factory should hide
the editor area, using the existing java methods.&nbsp; It is not acceptable
to resize the editor area to a point where it is no longer visible.&nbsp;
If the user does open an editor in the perspective, for whatever reason,
they will be unable to see or resize it.
<p>When the editor area is programmatically hidden, if the user opens an
editor in the perspective, the editor area will become visible. The view
that occupied the editor area before will be shrinked. Therefore, it is
important to define a non-empty editor area even when the editor is programmatically
hidden.

7.5</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">If it is undesirable to have an editor
area in a perspective, hide it.&nbsp; Do not resize the editor area to
the point where it is no longer visible.</font></blockquote>

<h4>
Action Contribution</h4>
The perspective factory may add actions to the File > New, Perspective
> Open, and&nbsp; Perspective > Show View menus.&nbsp; It is also possible
to add one or more action sets to the window.&nbsp; In each case, you should
choose actions which are relevant to the task orientation of the perspective.
<p>The File > New menu should be populated with wizards for the creation
of objects commonly used in the task.&nbsp; For instance, in the Java perspective
the File > New menu contains menu items for the creation of packages, classes,
and interfaces.
<p>The Perspective > Show View menu should be populated with the initial
views in the perspective, as well as any extra views that may be important
for the task at hand.
<p><img SRC="showViewMenu.jpg" height=493 width=421>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The application development lifecycle should be considered when populating
the the Perspective > Open menu.&nbsp; The development of most applications
follow a well defined lifecycle, from designing / modeling, to editing
/ creating, to debugging / testing, to assembling / deploying.&nbsp; Each
perspective will fall into one of these steps.&nbsp; The Perspective Open
menu should be used to linking the current perspective to perspectives
that support tasks immediately downstream of the current one, as well as
tasks further upstream, to allow for iterative development.
<p>For instance, the Java perspective is used in a larger lifecycle, involving
Java, Debug, and Team tasks.&nbsp; The Perspective > Open menu is populated
with each of these perspectives.

<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Populate the window menu bar with actions
and action sets which are appropriate to the task orientation of the perspective,

<h4>
Opening a Perspective in Code</h4>
An action should only open a new perspective if the user explicitly states
a desire to do so.&nbsp; If the user does not state a desire to do so,
it may cause loss of context.
<p>For instance, imagine a scenario where the user selects an object and
invokes an action.&nbsp; In the perspective where the action is invoked,
the user may have a set of views and editors open.&nbsp; These represent
the working state, or context, of the user.&nbsp; If a new perspective
is created, that context will be left behind, forcing the user to recreate
the context.&nbsp; This is time wasted.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
7.7 </font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">A new perspective should be opened only
if the user explicitly states a desire to do so.&nbsp; In making this statement,
the user agrees to leave their old context, and create a new one.</font></blockquote>
In some cases, a new perspective is opened as the side effect of another
action.&nbsp; For instance, if Project > Open Type is invoked, the resulting
editor may open in the current perspective, or a new one.&nbsp; If this
behavior is implemented, the user should have the option to turn this behavior
off.&nbsp; The option can be exposed in the action dialog, or within a
Preference page.

If a new perspective is opened, it may be opened as a page within the current
window, or in a new window.&nbsp; The user controls this option using the
Workbench Preferences.&nbsp; If code within a plug-in opens a new perspective,
the plug-in should honor the user preference.

In many scenarios, it may be better to replace the current perspective
<i>type</i>,
rather than open a new perspective.&nbsp; For instance, if the Debug action
is invoked in the Java perspective, the action may replace the perspective
type to Debug.&nbsp; When this approach is taken, the open editors and
views are carried forward to the new perspective, so no loss of context
is occurs.

<h3>
<a NAME="Windows"></a>Windows</h3>
In this section we look at the window menu bar, toolbar, and layout.&nbsp;
As a plug-in developer, you can contribute actions to the menu bar and
toolbar using an <i>action set</i>, a set of task oriented actions which
the user can show or hide.&nbsp; You can control the layout of views within
a window by defining a <i>perspective</i>.&nbsp; In this section we'll
look at action extension.&nbsp; For more information on perspectives, see
<a href="#Perspectives">Perspectives</a>.
<h4>
Actions</h4>
Each workbench window contains a menu bar and toolbar.&nbsp; These are
pre-populated by the platform, but a plug-in developer may add additional
items to each.&nbsp; This is done by defining an <i>action set</i>, a set
of task oriented actions which the user can show or hide.&nbsp; The actions
within an action set may be distributed through-out the window menu bar
and toolbar.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
8.1</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Use an Action Set to contribute actions
to the window menu bar and toolbar.</font></blockquote>
The window menu bar contains a number of pulldown menus: File, Edit, Perspective,
Project, Window, and Help.&nbsp; Each of these has a different purpose,
which will be explained in the following paragraphs.&nbsp; For consistency
with the action sets contributed by other plug-ins, the actions within
an action set should conform to the existing distribution of actions in
the window.&nbsp; There is no need to group the actions in a separate pulldown
menu of the menu bar.
<p>The File menu contains file oriented actions, such as Save, Close, Print,
Import, Export and Exit.&nbsp; The contents of the File > New menu are
determined by the perspective type.&nbsp; However, the user may add or
remove items using the Perspective > Customize menu item.&nbsp; The contents
of the Import and Export dialogs are populated with every import and export
wizard, respectively.
<p>The Edit menu contains editor oriented actions, such as Undo, Redo,
Cut, Copy, and Paste.&nbsp; These actions target the active part (as indicated
by a shaded title bar) .&nbsp; It is very common for an editor to add items
to this menu.&nbsp; However, it is uncommon for an action set to add actions
to the Edit Menu; action sets tend to be global in nature, while the edit
menu targets a specific part, and interaction with the data in that part.
<p>The Perspective menu contains actions which affect the state of the
window contents, such as Open Perspective, Show View and Close Perspective.
<p>The Project menu contains actions which apply to the contents of the
workspace, such as Rebuild All and Open Type.&nbsp; An action set may add
actions which search the entire workspace, generate project info, open
editors, etc.
<p>The Window menu contains actions which apply to window management and
system preferences.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
8.2</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Follow the platform lead when distributing
actions within an Action Set.</font></blockquote>
The toolbar contains the most commonly used actions of the menu bar.&nbsp;
In reflection of this, you should contribute actions to the menu bar first,
and then to the toolbar if they will be frequently used.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
8.3</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Contribute actions to the window menu
bar first, and then to the window toolbar if they will be frequently used.</font></blockquote>
The contents of each action set should be defined using a task oriented
approach.&nbsp; For instance, the Java action set contains actions to create
a new package, class and interfaces.&nbsp; It also contains an action to
open an editor on a class, Goto Type. These form a cohesive set of related
actions, which can be turned on and off by the user, depending on the active
task.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
8.4</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Define each action set with a specific
task in mind.</font></blockquote>
The size of an action set is also important.&nbsp; If an action set is
too large, it will flood the menu or toolbar, and reduce the users ability
to customize the menu and toolbar.&nbsp; At the same time, if an action
set is too small, the user may find customization of the menu and toolbar
is too labor intensive.&nbsp; Break an action set up when it has more than
about 7 items.
<p>There is no magic number for the size of an action set, but it should
be carefully designed to contain the smallest possible semantic chunking
of actions. Avoid the temptation to provide only one action set for an
entire plug-in.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
8.5</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">An action set should contain the smallest
possible semantic chunking of actions. Avoid the temptation to provide
only one action set for an entire plug-in.</font></blockquote>
An action set can be used to share a set of actions between two or more
views and editors.&nbsp; For instance, a Java Refactor action set may be
applicable to the selection within a Java Editor, an Outline view, and
a Hierarchy View.&nbsp; In this situation the actions can be shared by
defining an action set extension for the workbench.&nbsp; Once this action
set has been defined, it can be automatically included in a perspective
by the perspective developer, or added to a perspective by the user.
<p>An action set should not be used to promote action from a single view
to the window menu bar and toolbar.&nbsp; This simply clutters up the user
interface.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
8.6</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Use an action set to share a set of actions
which are useful in two or more views or editors.</font></blockquote>
The set of visible action in a window may be changed by invoking Perspective
> Customize.&nbsp; Within the resulting dialog, you can add or remove items
from the File > New menu, Perspective > Open menu, or Perspective > Show
View menu.&nbsp; It is also possible to add or remove action sets.&nbsp;
In general, the visible action sets should be controlled by the user, and
should never be changed programmatically.&nbsp; There are two reasons for
this.&nbsp; First, users like to control the environment, not be controlled.&nbsp;
And second, the user is in the best position to understand the active task,
and the appropriate action sets for its completion.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
8.7</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Let the user control the visible action
set.&nbsp; Don't try to control it for them.</font></blockquote>

<h4>
Common Window Actions</h4>
A common example of an action which may be added to an action set is Project
> Open Type.&nbsp; This action can be used to open an editor on a type
which is not visible in the current window, and is a form of lateral navigation.&nbsp;
In general, all Open actions which take the form should be added to the
Project menu, for consistency.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
8.8</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">"Open Object" actions must appear in
the Project pulldown menu of the window.</font></blockquote>
Any action within an action set, which opens another application, should
be added to the Window pulldown menu.&nbsp; This approach is consistent
with the existing functionality of the Window menu, where you can navigate
from one window to another within the workbench.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
8.9</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">"Open Application" actions must appear
in the Window pulldown menu of the window.</font></blockquote>

<h4>
Status Bar</h4>
If there is a need for a plug-in to show non-modal contextual information
in the status bar area, always use the global status bar.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline

<h3>
<a NAME="Properties"></a>Properties</h3>
A Properties dialog or view is used to view / modify the properties of
an object which are not visible in the normal presentation of that object.
For instance, the Read Only attribute for a file is modified in the Properties
Dialog.&nbsp; The build path for a Java Project is modified in the Properties
Dialog.
<p>Within Eclipse, there are two ways to edit the properties of an object:
in the Properties dialog, and in the Properties view.&nbsp; Each of these
is applicable in different situations.
<p>The Properties view is commonly used to edit the properties for a set
of objects in an editor, where quick access to the properties is important,
and you switch from one object to another quickly.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
9.1</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Use the Properties view to edit the properties
of an object when quick access is important, and you will switch quickly
from object to object.</font></blockquote>
The properties for an object should be quick to calculate.&nbsp; If it
is too expensive to calculate the properties for an object, the quick access
to properties offered by the Properties view becomes worthless.&nbsp; In
this situation, where quick access is not possible, a Properties Dialog
should be used.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
9.2</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Use a Properties Dialog to edit the properties
of an object which are expensive to calculate.</font></blockquote>
In some cases, the properties for an object are dependent upon one another,
such that a change in one will affect another, or even enable / disable
the option to change another.&nbsp; In this situation, a Properties Dialog
may be a better way to represent the semantic link between these properties.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
9.3</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">&nbsp;Use a Properties Dialog to edit
the properties of an object which contain complex relationships to one
another.</font></blockquote>
When both the Properties view and the Properties Dialog are used to present
and edit properties of an object, the Properties Dialog should contain
the superset of items shown in the Properties view.

<h2>
<a NAME="Standard Components"></a>Standard Components</h2>
In this section we'll look at the standard components which ship with Eclipse.&nbsp;
The Eclipse SDK contains a number of views, including the Navigator, Outline,
Properties, Tasks, and Bookmarks view.&nbsp; Eclipse also contains a default
text editor and a Resource perspective.
<p>As a plug-in developer, you should try to add new actions to the existing
parts.&nbsp; This leads to better integration with the platform, and the
existing knowledge of the user.
<br>&nbsp;

<p><br>When extending the standard components such as the Navigator, Outline,

<h3>
<a NAME="Navigator"></a>The Navigator View</h3>
The Navigator is used to navigate the workspace, create new resources,
modify resources, and open an editor on a resource.&nbsp; Plug-in developers
may contribute new actions to the menu, toolbar, and context menu.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Adding Actions</h4>
This is done by adding an extension to the plug-in registry.
<p><img SRC="guidelineIndicator.gif" height=16 width=16><b><font color="#3333FF">Guideline
11.1</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Add actions to the Navigator View menu,
toolbar, and context menu using the plug-in registry.</font></blockquote>
If object contributions are made to the context menu, try to qualify the
target object as much as possible, to avoid adding the action to the wrong
objects in the Navigator.&nbsp; For instance, a Java action may target
IFiles with a .java extension, or IProjects with a Java nature.&nbsp; It
will cause confusion if Java actions appear on non-java objects.
<p>Some actions are a reflection of tool use, rather than object type.&nbsp;
For instance, a repository plug-in may provide actions for file check in,
check out, etc.&nbsp; These actions should only appear on the resources
in the Navigator if the user has actively chosen to use the repository
tool.&nbsp; To control the visibility of these actions, the plug-in should
apply a project nature to the managed resources, and use the project nature
attribute in all context menu contributions.
<p>For more information on action filtering,&nbsp; refer to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/viewArticle/ViewArticle2.html" target="_top">Creating 
  an Eclipse View</a>.&nbsp; The standard attributes for resources are defined 
  in IResourceActionFilter.java (see below). 
<pre>public interface IResourceActionFilter extends IActionFilter {

<h4>
Integration with Other Views and Editors</h4>
In Eclipse, the use of a "Show In" action is a common way to link the selection
in one view to the input of another.&nbsp; For instance, a "Show in Packages"
action is visible in the context menu for a class in the Outline view.&nbsp;
When invoked, the class in the Outline view is selected and revealed in
the Packages view.&nbsp; This approach should be used as a general, non
intrusive pattern for view or editor linking.&nbsp; It is context sensitive,
and reflects the intentions of the user.
<p>A "Show In Navigator" action should be included in any view where a
resource may appear.&nbsp; If invoked, the action should select and reveal
the resource in the navigator.

<h3>
<a NAME="Tasks"></a>The Tasks View</h3>
The Tasks view is used to display the current tasks, errors and warnings

those objects.&nbsp; You can also contribute new actions to the menu, toolbar,

text of each marker should be short and concise, so that it will fit in
the status line of Eclipse.

<h3>
<a NAME="The Preference Dialog"></a>The Preference Dialog</h3>
The Preference Dialog is used to edit the global preference for a feature
in the workbench.
<p>A new preference page should be created when you need to expose global
options to the user.&nbsp; For instance, the global preferences for Java
compilation are exposed as a group of preference pages in the Preference
Dialog.&nbsp; If these preferences are changed, they affect the entire
Java plug-in.

13.1</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Global options should be exposed within

A preference page should not be used to expose the local options for a
particular instance of a view, editor, or window.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this situation,
the user will look to the menu and toolbar of the control itself to customize
it.&nbsp; If these options are exposed in the Preference Dialog, it will
blur the location of customization, and confuse the user.

<h4>
Preference Page Design</h4>
In the simplest case, any plug-in which needs to expose an option to the
user will define a single preference page.&nbsp; This preference page should
contain all of the options for the plug-in, until the number of options
starts to overload the page.&nbsp; At that point a nested design for preference
pages should be adopted.

13.3</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#3333FF">Start out with a single preference page.&nbsp;
Then evolve to more if you need to.</font></blockquote>
In a nested design, a root preference page is added to the preference dialog,
and then sub pages are added to the root preference page.&nbsp; The root
preference page should never be blank.&nbsp; Instead, it should contain
the most commonly used preferences, or those preferences which have a wide
spread effect upon the plug-in behavior.&nbsp; Beneath the root page, a
sub page should be created for each major chunk of functionality within
the plug-in.
<p>There is no reason to set the focus in a preference page, because focus
is always set to the tree, by the Eclipse platform, after the preference
page is made visible.

an outline model, that model will be displayed in the Outline view whenever
the editor is active.&nbsp; The outline is used to navigate through the
edit data, or interact with the edit data at a higher level of abstraction.

<h2>
<a NAME="The Tao of IResource"></a>The Tao of Resource</h2>
In Eclipse, the notion of a tool disappears.&nbsp; In its place, is the
idea of a universal tool platform - an open, extensible IDE - where tool
plug-ins are added to extend the capabilities of the platform.&nbsp; These
plug-ins "teach" Eclipse how to work with things - java files, web content,
graphics, video - almost anything you can imagine.&nbsp; At an implementation
level, these plug-ins communicate using resources (projects, folders, and
files).&nbsp; The resource is the common medium for integration between
plugins and external tools.
<p>The resource concept was developed for a number of reasons:

Integration between a plug-in from one vendor, and a plug-in from another,
is only possible if there is a common, well known data abstraction.</li>

Integration with external tools is only possible if everything, at some
level, is a file.</li>
</ol>

<p><br>Resources are also important at the UI level.&nbsp; If an object
action, decorator, or property page contribution is made to an IResource,
the platform will ensure that this contribution is visible in any view
or editor where the resource appears.&nbsp; For instance, a .java file
will be visible in the Navigator, the Hierarchy view, and the Packages
view.&nbsp; To the user, the .java file is the same object, regardless
of the view where it appears, so the object appearance, context menu, and
properties should be consistent in each view.
<p>In some cases, the implementation of a particular view or editor may
wrap a resource within another object, for presentation purposes.&nbsp;
If the wrapper is equivalent to a resource, it is important to expose this
equivalence to the platform.&nbsp; If the resource is exposed, the platform
may apply resource contributions to the resource equivalent object.&nbsp;
This ensures presentation consistency for an object in the platform.
<p>The underlying resource for an object is exposed by implementing IAdaptable
on the model object, and answering an IContributorResourceAdapter.&nbsp;
For more information on the implementation of an IContributorResourceAdapter,
refer to Eclipse Corner.

<dt>
<b>Action</b></dt>

<dd>
An <i>action</i> represents a command which can be triggered by the user
from a menu or toolbar.&nbsp; It has a run method, plus other methods which
return the menu or tool item presentation (text, image, etc.).&nbsp; In
Eclipse, you can add actions to a menu or toolbar in a view, editor, or
window.&nbsp; In a view or editor, actions are added individually, one
by one.&nbsp; In the window, actions are added using an <i>action set</i>,
a set of actions which can be turned on or off by the user.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Bookmarks View</b></dt>

<dd>
A view used to browse the bookmarks in the workbench.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Editor</b></dt>

<dd>
An editor is a visual component within a workbench page. It is typically
used to edit or browse a document or input object. The input is identified
using an &lt;code>IEditorInput&lt;/code>.&nbsp; Modifications made in an
editor part follow an open-save-close lifecycle model (in contrast to a
view part, where modifications are saved to the workbench immediately).</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>File</b></dt>

<dd>
An object in the workspace, analogous to files in the file system.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Folder</b></dt>

<dd>
A container for files in the workspace.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Navigator View</b></dt>

<dd>
A view used to browse the files in the workspace</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Outline View</b></dt>

<dd>
A view, commonly used to view the outline of the active editor.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Perspective</b></dt>

<dd>
A perspective is a visual container for a set of views and editors (parts).&nbsp;
These parts exist wholly within the perspective and are not shared.&nbsp;
A perspective is also like a page within a book.&nbsp; It exists within
a window along with any number of other perspectives and, like a page within
a book, only one perspective is visible at any time.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Platform</b></dt>

<dd>
A generic framework for the integration of tools.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Preferences</b></dt>

<dd>
A Preference Page is used to edit the preferences for a feature in the
platform.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Project</b></dt>

<dd>
A group of files and folders within the workspace.&nbsp; Each project maps
to a corresponding user specified directory in the file system.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Properties View</b></dt>

<dd>
A view, typically used to browse the properties for an object in the active
editor or view.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Properties Dialog</b></dt>

<dd>
A dialog for editing the properties of an object.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Property Page</b></dt>

<dd>
A page within a Properties Dialog.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Resource</b></dt>

<dd>
The generic name for projects, folders and files.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Tasks View</b></dt>

<dd>
A view used to browse the tasks, errors, and warnings within the workspace.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>View</b></dt>

<dd>
A view is a visual component within a workbench page.&nbsp; It is typically
used to navigate a hierarchy of information (like the workspace), open
an editor, or display properties for the active editor.&nbsp; Modifications
made in a view are saved immediately (in contrast to an editor part, which
conforms to a more elaborate open-save-close lifecycle).</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Wizard</b></dt>

<dd>
A Wizard is typically used to create new resources, import resources, or
export resources.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Workbench</b></dt>

<dd>
The Workbench provides the user interface structure for Eclipse. The purpose
of the Workbench is to facilitate the seamless integration of tools. These
tools contribute to extension points defined by the Workbench.&nbsp; The
Workbench is responsible for the presentation and coordination of the user
interface.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Workspace</b></dt>

<dd>
The various tools plugged in to the Eclipse Platform operate on regular
files in the user's workspace.&nbsp; The workspace consists of one or more
top level projects, where each project maps to a corresponding user specified
directory in the file system.&nbsp; Each project contains a collection
of folders and files.</dd>
