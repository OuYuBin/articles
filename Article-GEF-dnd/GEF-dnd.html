	<b>Summary</b> <br>
	Native drag and drop provides the ability to drag data from one GUI object to another GUI 
	object, which could potentially be in another application. GEF allows access to the operating 
	system's underlying drag and drop infrastructure through SWT. This article will provide an in-depth look at GEF&#39;s drag and drop functionality and show some simple 
	examples of how to take advantage of this API.<p><b>Eric Bordeau, IBM</b> <br>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Native drag and drop means the operating system&#39;s underlying drag and drop mechanism is used. This is 
different from when you drag EditParts around inside a single viewer. By using native drag and drop, 
you can transfer items between views, editors, windows and even between different applications (providing 
both applications support the transfer of that particular type of object). But not only will you be able to 
utilize other plug-ins&#39; and applications&#39; drag and drop capabilities, the opposite is also true. By using 
native drag and drop, you open the door for other plug-ins and applications to interact with your application 
in ways you may not have envisioned.
</p>
<h2>An SWT Example</h2>
<p>In order to access the operating system&#39;s drag and drop facilities, GEF 
  uses SWT&#39;s DragSource and DropTarget API. (If you would like more information 
  on how SWT's drag and drop mechanism works, see Veronika Irvine's <a href="../Article-SWT-DND/DND-in-SWT.html">SWT 
  drag and drop article</a>.) To use SWT's drag and drop support, you need to 
  create a DragSource and/or DropTarget for your control. Then you can add DragSourceListeners 
  and/or DropTargetListeners to handle the drag and drop events. Here's a simple 
  drag and drop example that allows you to drag from a tree and drop the tree 
  item into a text field, changing the text field's text to that of the tree item. 
</p>

import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*;

public class DNDExample {

 public static void main(String[] args) {
   Shell shell = new Shell();
   shell.setBackground(new Color(null, 200, 200, 200));
   shell.setLayout(new GridLayout(2, false));

   // Create the tree and some tree items

      }
   });

   shell.open();

}</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>The DragSourceListener needs to set the data being dragged during 
the dragSetData event and the DropTargetListener needs to do something with that data during the 
drop event.<p>GEF uses SWT's DragSource and DropTarget to facilitate its drag and drop function. When adding a drag listener to your EditPartViewer, a DragSource gets created and hooked into the 
underlying control. And similarly, a DropTarget gets created when adding a drop listener. But instead 
of adding your listener directly to the DragSource or DropTarget, the viewer creates a DelegatingDragSourceAdapter 
or DelegatingDropTargetAdapter, respectively, and adds them to their corresponding widget. Then, your 
listener gets added to the delegating adapter. When events are dispatched by the DragSource or DropTarget, 
the corresponding delegating adapter gets notified and it in turn delegates the event to the proper 
listener.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of delegating the drag and drop events in this way is to ease the separation 
of listeners by Transfer type. Code is simpler to read because each listener is only concerned with 
one type of transfer. And extension of drag and drop functionality is simplified since all 
that needs to be done is to add a new listener. Delegation of drag and drop events allows for a 
consensus of all the available listeners -- if one listener can handle the drag, it's allowed to do 
so, instead of letting the last listener determine whether the drag will be aborted or not. SWT lets you add 
multiple listeners but doesn't achieve the same effect. Delegating allows for easier 
maintainability of code and extension by third-party plug-ins.</p>
<h2>Adding a Listener to a Graphical Editor</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s just get started with some code. I'll be describing how to add drop functionality to the logic editor 
(available from our <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/gef/downloads/">download page</a>). 
This will 
allow the user to drag files from the Navigator or Package Explorer (or any file explorer that 
supports dragging files) and drop them onto the logic editor. 
The editor will respond by creating a new label with the file name as its text. First off, you need 
a TransferDropTargetListener (GEF provides you with AbstractTransferDropTargetListener for you to subclass). 
Create a subclass called FileTransferDropTargetListener:
</p>
<table border cols="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
	<tr>
		<td><pre>package org.eclipse.gef.examples.logicdesigner.dnd;

import org.eclipse.swt.dnd.FileTransfer;
import org.eclipse.swt.dnd.Transfer;
import org.eclipse.gef.EditPartViewer;
import org.eclipse.gef.dnd.AbstractTransferDropTargetListener;

public class FileTransferDropTargetListener 
   extends AbstractTransferDropTargetListener 
{

   public FileTransferDropTargetListener(EditPartViewer viewer, Transfer xfer) {
      super(viewer, xfer);
   }

   public FileTransferDropTargetListener(EditPartViewer viewer) {
      super(viewer, FileTransfer.getInstance());
   }

   protected void updateTargetRequest() {}

}</pre></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The first thing you need to do is override createTargetRequest() to create the appropriate request. 
CreateRequest should be used so that a new label will be created when a file is dropped on the editor. 
The CreateRequest needs a CreationFactory to create the new object that will be passed to the command. 
You should implement your own factory that will create a new LogicLabel based on the file name (which you will 
set later during the drop event).</p>
<table border cols="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
	<tr>
		<td><pre>package org.eclipse.gef.examples.logicdesigner.dnd;

import org.eclipse.gef.requests.CreationFactory;
import org.eclipse.gef.examples.logicdesigner.model.LogicLabel;

public class FileLabelFactory implements CreationFactory {

   private String text = &quot;&quot;;

   public Object getNewObject() {
      LogicLabel label = new LogicLabel();
      label.setLabelContents(text);
      return label;
   }

   public Object getObjectType() {
      return LogicLabel.class;
   }

   public void setText(String s) {
      text = s;
   }
}</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Now that we&#39;ve got our factory, we can add a field to our drop listener to store this factory...</p>
<table border cols="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
	<tr>
		<td><pre>private FileLabelFactory factory = new FileLabelFactory();</pre></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>and set the factory on the CreateRequest during createTargetRequest()...</p>
<table border cols="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
	<tr>
		<td><pre>protected Request createTargetRequest() {
   CreateRequest request = new CreateRequest();
   request.setFactory(factory);
   return request;
}</pre></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Next, implement updateTargetRequest() by setting the current drop location on the request.</p>
<table border cols="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
	<tr>
		<td><pre>protected void updateTargetRequest() {
   ((CreateRequest)getTargetRequest()).setLocation(getDropLocation());
}</pre></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
Now since we&#39;ll be dragging files from the Navigator (or any file explorer), we want to ensure that 
the file won&#39;t be deleted. To do this, override handleDragOver() and set the drop detail to DND.DROP_COPY. 
If we leave it as the default (DND.DROP_MOVE), after the drop the drag source will assume the file 
is somewhere else and remove the original. We want the file to stay right where it is.</p>
<table border cols="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
	<tr>
		<td><pre>protected void handleDragOver() {
   getCurrentEvent().detail = DND.DROP_COPY;
   super.handleDragOver();
}</pre></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Finally, we need to implement handleDrop() to get the file name from 
the current DropTargetEvent. The data field of the event is typed as Object but 
the actual data type is dependent on the transfer type. For FileTransfers, the 
data is a String array storing the full paths of the files being dragged. To make 
this easier, we&#39;ll only be concerned with the first file in the list and we&#39;ll 
only display the file name, not the full path. Once we extract this information 
from the current event, set the text on the factory and the superclass will do 
the rest.</p>
<table border cols="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
	<tr>
		<td><pre>protected void handleDrop() {
   String s = ((String[])getCurrentEvent().data)[0];
   String separator = System.getProperty("file.separator");
   s = s.substring(s.lastIndexOf(separator) + 1);
   factory.setText(s);
   super.handleDrop();
}</pre></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
That&#39;s all we need to do to implement our drop listener. The superclass will take care obtaining a Command from the target edit part and executing it. All that&#39;s left 
is to add the listener to our editor and see what happens. To do this, we need to change initializeGraphicalViewer() 
in the LogicEditor class. Notice there are already 2 drop listeners being added -- a LogicTemplateTransferDropTargetListener, 
which allows for dragging templates from the palette and dropping them onto the editor for creation; 
and a TextTransferDropTargetListener, which allows the user to drag text (such as from a word 
processor) and drop it on an already existing label 
to change the label text to match the text being dragged. We need to add our listener to the viewer by 
adding the following line to this method:</p>
<table border cols="1" width="100%" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
	<tr>
		<td><pre>getGraphicalViewer().addDropTargetListener(
       new FileTransferDropTargetListener(getGraphicalViewer()));</pre></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<h2>Behind The Scenes</h2>
<p>For most people, all you need (or want) to know is that when you add a listener to a viewer, the 
viewer creates a new DragSource or DropTarget, if one has not already been created. The viewer 
also ensures the DragSource/DropTarget is aware of the Transfers from all of the listeners that have 
been added. For those of you interested in a more intricate look at what's happening behind 
the scenes, read on. (I'll be explaining how drop 
listeners are added, but drag listeners work in a similar fashion.)
</p>
<p>When you add a TransferDropTargetListener to an EditPartViewer, the viewer adds the listener to the 
DelegatingDropAdapter. Next, the DropTarget is refreshed. During the refresh, the viewer 
checks to see if the DelegatingDropAdapter is empty (i.e. it has no listeners) and if so, sets the 
DropTarget (an SWT widget) to null. This occurs because when there are no listeners to delegate the drop 
events to, there's no reason to be notified of these drop events. When the first listener is 
added to the DelegatingDropAdapter (in other words, the DelegatingDropAdapter is not empty but the 
DropTarget is still null), the viewer creates a new DropTarget for the viewer's control and sets all 
possible styles (DND.DROP_MOVE, DND.DROP_COPY, DND.DROP_LINK). This makes all styles available to 
the delegated listeners, even if they don't use them. Finally, the viewer sets the Transfer types on 
the DropTarget by getting them from the DelegatingDropAdapter. The DelegatingDropAdapter 
obtains these transfer types by querying all of its listeners for their transfer types and adding 
them all to an array. This completes the DropTarget setup and the DelegatingDropAdapter will now be 
notified of DropTargetEvents. WARNING: You can't mix your own DropTarget with the DropTarget created 
by the viewer. This is because, according to the DropTarget javadoc, &quot;there can only be a one 
to one mapping between a Control and a DropTarget.&quot; If you try to create another DropTarget on the 
same control, you'll get an error.</p>
<p>The DelegatingDropAdapter chooses one listener to be active 
(inactive listeners will not receive events) and refreshes the active listener before each event. To 
be considered active, a listener must satisfy three conditions: 1) The transfer type of the listener 
must match up with the transfer type 
of the data being dragged. 2) There must be an EditPart under the mouse cursor that understands the 
listeners request. 3) The listener must be the first listener in the list to satisfy the first two 
conditions. The active listener could potentially change during each event, based on mouse location, 
modifier keys pressed, etc. In AbstractTransferDropTargetListener.isEnabled(DropTargetEvent), the 
listener tries to match its transfer type with one of the supported transfer types in the event. If 
a match is found, the listener tries to find an EditPart at the current mouse location that 
understands its target request. If a target edit part is found, the listener is enabled and 
the DelegatingDropTargetAdapter stops looking for listeners to handle this event. Then the event is 
actually delegated to the active listener. If the active listener changes, the old listener gets a 
dragLeave() event and the new listener gets a dragEnter() event to ensure proper initialization and 
clean-up is available.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Adding drag and drop support to an EditPartViewer is a fairly simple task. And by doing so, your GEF 
application will be able to interact with other views, editors and applications by transferring data 
at the OS level. All that is really needed is a subclass of AbstractTransferDragSourceListener or 
AbstractTransferDropTargetListener added to the viewer with the appropriate Transfer type. In 
this article, I introduced a very simple drop listener to demonstrate how easy it is to implement 
such a feature. Real-world applications would most likely perform a more meaningful task, but 
the overall process is the same.</p>
