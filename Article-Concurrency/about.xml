		Eclipse 3.0. It describes the main portions of the Jobs API and
		the use of scheduling rules. It also describes some changes to
		Eclipse resource management including how the Resources plug-in
		integrates with the new API. Finally, it describes some new UI
		functionality that has been added to provide feedback to users
		about jobs that are run in the background.
