		Handling a progress monitor instance is deceptively simple. It
		seems to be straightforward but it is easy to make a mistake
		when using them. And, depending on numerous factors such as the
		underlying implementation, how it is displayed, the result can
		range from completely ok, mildly confusing or outright
		silliness. In this article we lay down a few ground rules that
		will help anyone use progress monitors in a way that will work
		with the explicit and implicit contract of IProgressMonitor.
		Also, understanding the usage side makes it easier to understand
		how to implement a monitor.
