		Accessibility for disabled users is now a priority in
		application development as advances in techniques and support
		within operating systems have now made this possible. This
		article covers the Eclipse accessibility support, general tips
		for creating accessible plug-ins, and the types of disabilities
		that the Eclipse accessibility support assists. This is all
		illustrated using an example of making a view accessible.
