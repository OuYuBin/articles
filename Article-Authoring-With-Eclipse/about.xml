		The topic of technical publishing is relatively new to the world
		of Eclipse. One can make the argument that technical publishing
		is just another collaborative development process involving
		several people with different backgrounds and skills. This
		article will show that the Eclipse platform is a viable platform
		for technical publishing by discussing how to write documents
		such as an article or a book within Eclipse. In fact, this
		article was written using Eclipse.
