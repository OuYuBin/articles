		OpenGL is a vendor-neutral, multi-platform standard for creating
		high-performance 2D and 3D graphics. Hardware and software
		implementations exist on various operating systems, including
		Windows, Linux and MacOS. OpenGL may be used to render simple 2D
		charts or complex 3D games. This article describes an
		experimental Eclipse plug-in that facilitates the use of OpenGL
		for drawing onto SWT widgets. A short history and overview of
		OpenGL is presented, followed by an example application.
