		The types of problems web application developers face today
		require the use of a diverse set of tools that operate in many
		domains. In order to provide flexible tool integration, a tool
		integration platform must allow tool developers to target
		different levels or integration based on the desired level of
		investment, time to market, and specific tool needs. Each
		integration level determines how a tool must behave, and what
		end users can expect as a result. This article defines the
		different levels of tool integration supported by Eclipse, and
		gives an overview of how they work.
