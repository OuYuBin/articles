		The AspectJ Development Tools (AJDT) project is an Eclipse Tools
		project which enables the development of AspectJ applications in
		Eclipse. This article gives an overview of the capabilities of
		AJDT 1.4 for Eclipse 3.2 by describing several scenarios,
		including adding aspects to existing Java&amp;trade; projects,
		working with aspects across multiple projects, and using the
		load-time weaving capabilities of AspectJ 5.
