		This article discusses two central mechanisms that are
		associated with projects in an Eclipse workspace. The first of
		these is incremental project builders, which create some built
		state based on the project contents, and then keep that built
		state synchronized as the project contents change. The second is
		project natures, which define and manage the association between
		a given project and a particular plug-in or feature.
