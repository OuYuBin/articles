<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This article discusses four image effect algorithms that I explored
as part of my co-op work term on IBM's Eclipse SWT team. 
Implementations of a simple emboss, blur, glow, and drop shadow are 
included along with ideas for future improvements. My primary focus has
been on exploring basic algorithms for these effects.</p>
<h2>Emboss Algorithm</h2>
<p>The simplest graphical effect to explore is embossing, which gives images
a molded or chiseled appearance [1]. The algorithm entails comparing 
the intensity of each pixel in an image to one or more of its neighbors.
The red, green, and blue intensity components of a pixel are compared 
separately, and the largest difference found is used to determine the 
intensity of gray the resulting embossed pixel will display. An algorithm
may compare each pixel with a neighbor to its left, right, top, bottom,
or diagonal, or even a nearby pixel that is not adjacent at all.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Testing revealed that choosing a comparison pixel that was not directly
adjacent to the original pixel created the best embossed appearance.
This implementation of emboss compares a pixel to its neighbor one row
below and two columns to the left. Difficulties arise by following this
approach because the first two columns and last row do not have comparison
pixels. To solve the problem, these areas use a different comparison
direction.</p>
<div class="figure">
	<table>
	<tr>
	  <td><img src="images/emboss.jpg"><br>Original Image</td>
	  <td><img src="images/emboss_125.jpg"><br>Emboss: Gray level 125</td>
	  <td><img src="images/emboss_0.jpg"><br>Emboss: Gray level 0</td>
	</tr>	
	</table>
</div>
<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<p>In the future, the comparison direction and distance should be
configurable to allow for a more customizable emboss. In addition, the
embossed results should be more three-dimensional in appearance, as
they are in graphics packages like GIMP.</p>
<h2>Average Blur Algorithm</h2>
<p>Several types of blur filters exist such as Gaussian blur, average blur,
and motion blur. The average blur algorithm is explored here because of its
 fast run time and simple implementation. Similar to embossing, average 
blurring is an area filter —that is, a filtered pixel is based on both the
 original and its surrounding pixels [2]. Average blur is achieved by 
averaging a pixel's RGB intensities with the intensities of surrounding 
pixels within a certain square radius [2].</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Repeated calculations can be eliminated by performing the average blur
in two separate stages: a horizontal blur and then a vertical blur [3]. 
SWT's direct palette API supports retrieving an entire row of pixel data at
once, but not an entire column. As a result, the implementation simultaneously
performs a vertical blur on all columns of a row rather than all rows of a
column. This approach improves overall performance and space complexity by 
reducing the number of rows which must be cached during the vertical blurring 
stage.</p>
<div class="figure">
	<table>
	<tr>
	  <td><img src="images/blur.jpg"><br>Original Image</td>
	  <td><img src="images/blur_3.jpg"><br>Blur: Radius 3</td>
	  <td><img src="images/blur_10.jpg"><br>Blur: Radius 10</td>
	</tr>	
	</table>
</div>
<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<p>Average blur can be improved, at the expense of performance, by
considering a circular radius of neighboring pixels when blurring instead
of a square radius. This alteration would help eliminate horizontal and 
vertical artifacts that can become apparent in blurred images, especially if
they include borders [2]. Such a change introduces many new code
complexities because the blur cannot be completed in one averaging pass per
direction. 
<h2>Glow Algorithm</h2>
<p>In order to create a glowing visual effect in SWT, I created my own custom
algorithm. 
Glow can be achieved by creating a solid border around an image, then
 using alpha 
blending to diffuse the border from opaque to transparent. </p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>My glow implementation is designed to create a glow around a rectangular image.
First, a solid rectangular border is created around the image. The border's alpha
values 
are set based on a linear function of distance from the internal rectangle's
perimeter. 
In order to prevent the glow from becoming transparent too quickly, and
to better highlight
 the image, I introduced a highlight radius which creates a more
opaque border 
directly surrounding the image. 
</p>
<div class="figure">
	<table>
	<tr>
	  <td><img src="images/glow.jpg"><br>Original Image</td>
	  <td><img src="images/glow_15.jpg"><br>Glow: Radius 15</td>
	  <td><img src="images/glow_30.jpg"><br>Glow: Radius 30</td>
	</tr>	
	</table>
</div>
<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<p>My implementation of glow could be improved by supporting shapes other than rectangles.</p>
<h2>Drop Shadow Algorithm</h2>
<p>A drop shadow is simply a specialized glow. By altering the glow algorithm to only glow on

two sides, and with slightly altered dimensions, a drop shadow effect can be achieved.</p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<div class="figure">
	<table>
	<tr>
	  <td style="vertical-align:top"><img src="images/dropshadow.jpg"><br><div style="caption"><b>Original Image</b></div></td>
	  <td style="vertical-align:top"><img src="images/dropshadow_10.jpg"><br>Drop Shadow: Radius 10</td>
	  <td style="vertical-align:top"><img src="images/dropshadow_20.jpg"><br>Drop Shadow: Radius 20</td>
	</tr>	
	</table>
</div>
<h3>Future Improvements</h3>
<p>Like the glow algorithm, drop shadow can be improved by supporting shapes other than rectangles.

Once glow is altered to support shapes, an implementation for drop shadow should easily follow. 
In 
addition, the direction of the drop shadow should be configurable.
</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The implementations of these four algorithms can be built upon and eventually used to provide

advanced graphical effects for SWT. They should allow for more customization and display seamlessly

on or around any shape. In addition, the original transparency information of images should be
considered when applying image effects.

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>I would like to thank the entire SWT team for creating a fun, easygoing work environment, with 
special thanks to my
mentor, Bogdan Gheorghe, for his ongoing support, encouragement, and patience. 
My success (and this article) 
would not be possible without his direction.
