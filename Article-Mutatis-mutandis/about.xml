		A common problem in the implementation of applications is the
		implementation of project-specific properties that override
		workbench-wide preferences on project or file level. The naive
		approach is to implement these pages from scratch. However,
		writing the same code twice is a boring task and leads to
		increased maintenance efforts. In this article we show how
		existing preferences pages (with or without field editors) can
		be easily converted into pages that can act as both preference
		and property pages. We demonstrate this by implementing the
		abstract class FieldEditorOverlayPage providing the necessary
		functionality.
