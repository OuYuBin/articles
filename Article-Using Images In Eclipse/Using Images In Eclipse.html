Using Images in the Eclipse UI</h1></center>

<blockquote><b>Summary</b>
<br>
  Managing images in a large graphical application can be a daunting task. Since 
  modern operating systems such as Windows&reg; only support a small number of images 
  in memory at once, an application’s icons and background images must be carefully 
  managed and sometimes shared between widgets. This article describes the image 
  management facilities provided by the Eclipse Platform, along with some best 
  practice guidelines to keep in mind when writing your own Eclipse UI plug-ins. 
  We assume the reader already has a basic understanding of Eclipse, the UI extension 
  points defined by the Eclipse Platform, and the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT).

<h2> The Usual Suspects </h2>
<p>We begin by describing the interesting classes to know about when writing UI 
  plug-ins that define their own images. Just about anybody writing substantial 
  UI components for a plug-in needs to understand these basic image management 
  objects. </p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li> 
      <p><b><tt>org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Image</tt></b>. Instances of <tt>Image</tt> 
        are ready for display on the screen. They have all their data in memory, 
        and they maintain a handle to an underlying OS resource. These are heavy-weight 
        objects that generally should not be held onto indefinitely. When no longer 
        needed, the user must call <tt>dispose()</tt> on the Image to free the 
        underlying resource. The crucial point to understand here is that these 
        objects are very expensive to leave lying around. The operating system 
        typically only allows a fixed number of images at once. For example, Windows 
        98 only allows about 1000 images in memory before it begins to fail. Whenever 
        you create an instance of Image, think about how long it will be needed, 
        and make sure that a mechanism is in place to dispose of it when no longer 
        needed. You <b>cannot</b> rely on the Java&trade; garbage collector to do this 
        for you, since Images reference memory allocated by the OS, not the Java 
        virtual machine.&nbsp; An interesting characteristic of Images is that 
        one <tt>Image</tt> instance can be placed in multiple widgets, a technique 
        called image sharing.&nbsp; A major challenge of image management is to 
        take advantage of this sharing as much as possible, but to still know 
        when it is safe to dispose the image.</p>
    </li>
    <li> <b><tt>org.eclipse.jface.resource.ImageDescriptor</tt></b>. These objects 
      are very light-weight descriptions of images. They know how to find the 
      image data and load the image into memory, but they do not hold onto any 
      large structures themselves. There are a number of factory methods on ImageDescriptor 
      for creating descriptors from Java resource files, normal files, and URLs. 
      It is okay to create ImageDescriptors for all the images in your plug-in, 
      and keep them around for the lifetime of the UI.&nbsp; An SWT Image can 
      be created from an ImageDescriptor by calling its <tt>createImage</tt> method.&nbsp; 
      Each call to createImage returns a new instance of Image, and it is the 
      caller's responsibility to ensure that the created image gets disposed.</li>
    <li> <b><tt>org.eclipse.jface.resource.ImageRegistry</tt></b>. Some images are 
      used very frequently by a plug-in, and are worth placing in a global pool 
      so that they can be shared and reused throughout the UI. These images should 
      be placed in your plug-in's ImageRegistry. It is important to keep the number 
      of images in your registry small, so that you don't unnecessarily hog OS 
      resources that may be needed by other plug-ins.</li>
  </ul>
  As a general rule of thumb, ImageDescriptors should be used wherever possible 
in your UI code.&nbsp; However, in places where you are creating real widgets, 
such as subclasses of <tt>org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Widget</tt>, or <tt>org.eclipse.jface.window.Window</tt>, 
you need to be manipulating SWT images.&nbsp; Generally, the code that creates 
the widget should also create the Images to go in it, and the code that disposes 
the widget should also dispose of its images.&nbsp; An exception to this rule 
is if you are using Images that are shared between multiple widgets.&nbsp; Image 
sharing should be approached with caution, because as we discussed earlier, sharing 
makes it difficult to figure out when to dispose of the images.&nbsp; <tt>org.eclipse.jface.viewers.ILabelProvider</tt> 
(described later), and <tt>org.eclipse.jface.resource.ImageRegistry</tt>, are two 
mechanisms provided by JFace that help to achieve image sharing in a controlled 
manner. 
<h2>Defining Images Through Your plugin.xml File</h2>
  The simplest and most frequent way images get added to a UI plug-in is via their 
  plugin.xml file.&nbsp; Many UI extension points allow an image filename to be 
  provided directly in your extension definition, namely: 
  <ul>
  <li> "actions" elements on the org.eclipse.ui.actionSets extension point</li>
  <li> "editor" elements on the org.eclipse.ui.editors extension point</li>
  <li> "action" elements on the org.eclipse.ui.editorActions extension point</li>
  <li> "wizard" elements on the org.eclipse.ui.newWizards extension point</li>
  <li> "wizard" elements on the org.eclipse.ui.importWizards extension point</li>
  <li> "wizard" elements on the org.eclipse.ui.exportWizards extension point</li>
  <li> "perspective" elements on the org.eclipse.ui.perspectives extension point</li>
  <li> "action" elements on the org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus extension point</li>
  <li> "page" elements on the org.eclipse.ui.propertyPages extension point</li>
  <li> "action" elements on the org.eclipse.ui.viewActions extension point</li>
  <li> "view" elements on the org.eclipse.ui.views extension point</li>
  <li> "image" elements on the org.eclipse.ui.projectNatureImages extension point (since Eclipse 2.0)</li>
  <li> "workingSet" elements on the org.eclipse.ui.workingSets extension point (since Eclipse 2.0)</li>


  </ul>
  For all of these element types, the way you specify images is the same.&nbsp; 
There is an attribute called "icon", whose value must be an image filename relative 
to your plug-in's install location.&nbsp; To give a quick example, here is an 
XML definition of an import wizard, taken from the extension point documentation: 
<pre><tt>&lt;extension</tt> 
   <tt>point="org.eclipse.ui.import"></tt> 
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;wizard</tt> 
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; id="com.xyz.ImportWizard1"</tt>      
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name="XYZ Web Scraper"</tt>      
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class="com.xyz.imports.ImportWizard1"</tt>      
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; icon="./images/import1.gif"></tt>      
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/wizard></tt> 
<tt>&lt;/extension></tt>    </pre>
<p>Here, the wizard is given an image called "import1.gif", found in a subdirectory 
  of the plug-in's base directory called "images".&nbsp; See the documentation 
  for each of the above extension points for more details and examples of their 
  use. </p>
<p>There are many advantages to specifying images directly in your XML file, over 
  defining images programmatically in your UI code: 
<ul>
    <li> You can let the Platform worry about loading the image, storing it, and 
      disposing of it when no longer needed, which means less code and less bugs 
      for you to worry about.</li>
    <li> Most of your image filenames are encoded in one place, making it easier 
      to change and modify them.</li>
    <li> Your plug-in will take advantage of the Platform's lazy plug-in loading 
      mechanism.&nbsp; Your classes and images will only be loaded when they are 
      referenced by the user, and not before.&nbsp; In fact, this is why extension 
      points always ask for a name and icon for your actions, views, etc.&nbsp; 
      That way, the Platform can present them in menus and toolbars without having 
      to load your classes until they are really needed.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2> Adding Images to Custom UI</h2>
  You have begun experimenting with platform extension points, maybe contributing 
  some actions to popup menus or toolbars, or maybe you've even defined your own 
  custom view. In many of these cases, specifying an image file in the XML file 
  for your plug-in is all that is required, and the Platform takes care of the 
  rest.&nbsp; However, when you move on to writing more advanced UI components, 
  you may need to define images from within your code.&nbsp; The following example 
  demonstrates the simplest way to define images within UI code. In this example 
  we have a UI plug-in called MyPlugin, and some action called MyAction. We would 
  like to associate an image with MyAction. 
  <p>Step 1: Create an image using your favorite image editing program. For action 
    icons, the recommended format is a 16x16 pixel image in the GIF format. For 
    this example, we'll call the image "my_action.gif", and place it in a subdirectory 
    of the plug-in base directory called "images". 
  <p>Step 2: Define an ImageDescriptor in your MyAction class. It's a good idea 
    to make this field static so that it can be shared across instances of the 
    action. 
  
<pre>public class MyAction extends Action {
  private static ImageDescriptor image;
  static {
    URL url = null;
    try {
    url = new URL(MyPlugin.getInstance().getDescriptor().getInstallURL(),
                  "images/my_action.gif");
    } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
    }
    image = ImageDescriptor.createFromURL(url);
  }
	  ... other methods and fields defined here ...
}
  </pre>
  <p>Because plug-ins can be stored anywhere, we use URLs to describe their location. 
    The image location will always be the same relative to the plug-in location, 
    so we use that as the base of the image's URL. We then use the factory method 
    defined on the ImageDescriptor class to create our descriptor. The method 
    ImageDescriptor#createFromURL() will handle the case where a null URL is passed 
    to it, so we don't need to handle the possible URL exception. Images that 
    could not be loaded are visible in the UI as small red squares. If you see 
    a red square next to your action in the popup menu, it probably means you 
    got the image location wrong, or the image is missing. 
  <p>Step 3: Set the ImageDescriptor as the action's image in the constructor: 
  
<pre>public MyAction() { 
    super("My Action", image);
}</pre>
<p>That's it! Now, when you startup the Eclipse UI and find your action in a menu 
  or toolbar, your image will appear next to it. The same approach can be used 
  to define images within custom views and wizards.&nbsp; Note that since you 
  only had to deal with ImageDescriptors in this example, no disposal was required.&nbsp; 
  In this case the platform is responsible for creating, managing, and disposing 
  any SWT Image it creates from the image descriptor you supplied. </p>
<h2> Viewers and Label Providers</h2>
  Adding images to actions and view titles is fairly simple in Eclipse. In these 
cases, the platform handles the creation and management of the real, underlying 
SWT image. When you start to add your own objects to viewers, things get a little 
bit more complicated. This is mainly because many objects in viewers tend to have 
the same icon. For example, all files in the Navigator have the same icon, as 
do all public Java fields in the Java Development Tooling (JDT) views. To make 
this efficient, we want to reuse the same SWT image object for all these items. 
This is accomplished by creating a label provider for your viewer. 
<p>You can think of label providers as containing a pool of images that lasts 
    for the lifetime of a particular viewer.&nbsp; They allow the same SWT Images 
    to be reused throughout the time that viewer's widget is open.&nbsp; Note 
    that ILabelProviders don't provide a way to share the same Image across multiple 
    viewers, which is fine because there are rarely more than a couple of viewers 
    open at any given time that could share images anyway.&nbsp; Generally, sharing 
    images across multiple viewers introduces a great deal of complexity for very 
    little gain. 
  <p>To give you an idea of how ILabelProviders work, it is instructive to step 
    through the lifetime of an ILabelProvider instance. 
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Creation:</b> The code that creates a viewer instance should also 
      create an instance of ILabelProvider to supply images for objects in that 
      viewer.&nbsp; The label provider is then set into the viewer by calling 
      <tt>org.eclipse.jface.viewer.ContentViewer#setLabelProvider(IBaseLabelProvider)<b>. 
      </b></tt><b>Important:</b>&nbsp; Once a label provider has been set into 
      a viewer, that viewer takes over ownership of the instance.&nbsp; A label 
      provider instance must never be passed to another viewer, or have any of 
      its methods invoked, once it has been allocated to a viewer.</li>
    <li> <b>Disposal:</b>&nbsp; The viewer is responsible for invoking dispose() 
      on its label provider when the underlying widget is closed.&nbsp; This <tt>dispose()</tt> 
      method must dispose of any images that were ever dispensed by that label 
      provider instance.</li>
  </ul>
  Now that you have an idea of how label providers are created and used, let's 
  take a look at how to implement one for your viewer.&nbsp; <tt>ILabelProvider</tt> 
  defines the following method for creating images: 
  
<pre>public Image getImage(Object object);</pre>
<p>This method is called by the viewer framework for each item in the viewer. 
    As a silly example, let's say you have a fruit view that wants to display 
    various fruits. Your label provider might look as follows: 
  <p><tt>public class FruitLabelProvider extends LabelProvider {</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private Image appleImage = new Image(…);</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private Image kiwiImage = new Image(…);</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public Image getImage(Object object) {</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (object.getClass() == Apple.class) 
    {</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return 
    appleImage;</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (object.getClass() == Kiwi.class) 
    {</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return 
    kiwiImage;</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return null;</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public String getLabel(Object o) {</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //return appropriate labels 
    for the various fruits</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public void dispose() {</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appleImage.dispose();</tt> 
    <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appleImage = null;</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kiwiImage.dispose();</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kiwiImage = null;</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</tt> <br>
    <tt>}</tt> 
  <p>Some interesting things to note about this label provider: 
  <ul>
    <li> If it failed to find an appropriate image, it just returned null. This 
      is allowed by the spec, and it also means your code won't blow up if you 
      throw in some extra fruits later on. When dealing with images, it's generally 
      better to have no image than for your code to fail.</li>
    <li> The images were disposed in the label provider's dispose method. This 
      is VERY IMPORTANT! Anywhere an SWT Image is defined, there must be corresponding 
      code to dispose the image. Even though this is Java, you can't rely on the 
      garbage collector to free up unused images.</li>
    
  <li> The class extended LabelProvider rather than implementing the interface 
    ILabelProvider directly. This is handy because it means you don't have to 
    implement the methods on ILabelProvider for which you aren't interested.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2> The ImageRegistry</h2>
  The <tt>ImageRegistry</tt> is only intended to be used for Images that appear 
  frequently (and in large numbers) in the UI. Since these high-use images need 
  to be shared, they cannot be disposed by those using them. For this reason, 
  the <tt>ImageRegistry</tt> is provided to automatically manage these images, 
  and to dispose of them when the plug-in is shutdown. Many of the images used 
  by a plug-in should not be placed in the registry, since OS limitations on the 
  number of images in memory can easily be reached. Lower-frequency images should 
  instead be managed by having a table of <tt>ImageDescriptor</tt> instances in 
  your plug-in, and to create new images each time they are needed from the information 
  in the table of descriptors. 
  <p>The easiest way to use an <tt>ImageRegistry</tt> in your plug-in is to make 
    your <tt>Plugin</tt> class a subclass of <tt>org.eclipse.ui.plugin.AbstractUIPlugin</tt>.&nbsp; 
    This class creates an <tt>ImageRegistry</tt> automatically (one per plug-in 
    instance), if requested using the <tt>getImageRegistry()</tt> method.&nbsp; 
    This registry can then be populated with ImageDescriptors in your plug-in 
    by overriding the <tt>initializeImageRegistry(ImageRegistry)</tt> method.&nbsp; 
    The registry will then lazily generate and manage SWT images as they are requested.&nbsp; 
    The registry knows how to dispose of itself when the UI shuts down. 
  <p>It is possible to create instances of <tt>ImageRegistry</tt> manually, without 
    using the <tt>AbstractUIPlugin</tt>'s mechanism. However, this should be done 
    with caution.&nbsp; An <tt>ImageRegistry</tt>, once created, cannot be closed 
    until the whole UI shuts down.&nbsp; They should only be created and used 
    if you genuinely have need for images that last for the whole lifetime of 
    your plug-in. 
  
<h2> Using Global Images Provided by Other Plug-ins</h2>
  Some plug-ins may expose their global images so that other plug-ins can make 
use of them.&nbsp; Not only does this improve efficiency by allowing a single 
Image instance to be used across several plug-ins, it also helps to provided 
a consistent and integrated feel to the workbench.&nbsp; If a file, folder or 
bookmark looked different from plug-in to plug-in it would result in a confusing 
experience for end-users. 
<p>The technique used for making Images available in a plug-in's API may vary 
  between plug-ins.&nbsp; The Platform UI provides an interface called <tt>org.eclipse.ui.ISharedImages</tt>, 
  accessible from the workbench.&nbsp; This interface supplies images and image 
  descriptors corresponding to a set of keys defined in ISharedImages.&nbsp; See 
  the JavaDoc for that class for descriptions of all the available methods.&nbsp; 
  To give an example, say you want to obtain the image for a file object.&nbsp; 
  You would invoke the following: 
<p><tt>PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getSharedImages().getImage(ISharedImages.IMG_OBJ_FILE);</tt> 
  <p>The workbench is also accessible from <tt>AbstractUIPlugin</tt>, which your 
    plug-in class will typically subclass.&nbsp; Other plug-ins use a similar 
    approach for sharing their images.&nbsp; For example, the Java Development 
    Tooling supplies <tt>org.eclipse.jdt.ui.SharedImages</tt> in its API. 
  <p><b>Important: </b>Images provided by these APIs are shared, which means you 
    <b>must not </b>dispose of them.&nbsp; Again, following the general rule, 
    since you didn't create the image, it's not your responsibility to dispose 
    of it. 
  <p>If your plug-in defines images that may be useful to others, you may want 
    to use a similar approach to make them available in your API.&nbsp; Keep in 
    mind that the number of SWT Images shared by your plug-in should be small, 
    since these images will have to stay around for the lifetime of your plug-in. 
  <h2> Where Else Can I Look For Information About Images?</h2>
  If this article has left you scratching your head, don't worry.&nbsp; Eclipse 
has many layers of complexity, and it can take some time to wrap your head around 
the issues involved.&nbsp; The best thing to do is start with one of the examples, 
such as the readme example, and see what it's doing.&nbsp; The extension point 
documentation is an excellent place to learn about the various ways the base UI 
can be extended.&nbsp; Also, the entire Platform has extensive JavaDoc that describes 
each class and method in detail, which makes it easy to just dive in and starting 
learning how it all works.&nbsp; And of course, the <a href="http://www.eclipsecorner.org">Eclipse 
Corner</a> forums can be used to pose questions and get answers from experienced 
Eclipse developers.
