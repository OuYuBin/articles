		Application developers require the ability to run and debug code
		in order to test it. Tool developers require the ability to
		launch Java&#153; applications that assist in application
		development - for example, starting and stopping a Web server on
		which servlets, JSPs, and HTML pages can be tested; or launching
		a VM on which scrapbook evaluations can be performed. This
		article focuses on the high-level API provided by the Java
		launching plug-in that tool developers can leverage for the
		programmatic launching of local Java applications.
