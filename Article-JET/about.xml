		Generating source code can save you time in your projects and
		can reduce the amount of tedious redundant programming.
		Generating source code can be powerful, but the program that
		writes the code can quickly become very complex and hard to
		understand. One way to reduce complexity and increase
		readability is to use templates. In this article you will learn
		how to create JET templates, how to use the JET Nature and JET
		Builder to automatically translate templates into Java classes,
		and how to use these classes to generate source code. This
		article also provides a short reference to the JET syntax.
