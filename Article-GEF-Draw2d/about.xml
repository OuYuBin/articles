		The Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) ships with a painting and
		layout plug-in called Draw2D. Draw2D provides figures and layout
		managers which form the graphical layer of a GEF application.
		This article focuses only on the use of Draw2D to render a
		simple UML class diagram. While Draw2D can be used for
		standalone purposes, it is not an editing framework. Most
		applications will use the GEF plug-in as the editing layer.
