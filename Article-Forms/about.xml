		Spice up your rich client with rich user experience using
		Eclipse Forms. Written as a thin layer on top of SWT, Eclipse
		Forms allow you to achieve the Web look in your desktop
		applications without using the embedded browser. This allows you
		to retain full control of the widgets in the UI and to maintain
		portability across all operating systems Eclipse already runs
		on. This article will take you from baby steps to advanced
		topics of the rich user interface experience of Eclipse Forms.
