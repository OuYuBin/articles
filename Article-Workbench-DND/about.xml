		In this article, we discuss the drag and drop facilities
		provided by JFace and the Eclipse platform UI. After reading
		this, you will know how to add drag and drop support to your own
		Eclipse views, and how that support will interact with the
		standard views in the Eclipse platform. Along the way, we'll
		also discuss that keyboard relative of drag and drop: cut and
		paste. You'll learn that putting your own custom objects on the
		clipboard is easy once you've figured out the basics of drag and
		drop.
