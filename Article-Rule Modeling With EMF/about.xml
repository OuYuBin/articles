		There are examples of meta-models defined in ECore for modeling objects and relational data.
		However, not much has been said about how to model rules. This article will define a
		meta-model in ECore for modeling rule-based systems. We will then use the meta-model to
		model the solution of a logical problem. Then we will compose some JET templates and
		generate code from the model, run the generated code through a rule engine and see that the
		logical problem is correctly solved.
