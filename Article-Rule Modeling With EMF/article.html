		<hr width="100%">
		<P>Before we look at this article’s example, let’s set the stage by going through 
			some&nbsp;background information and make clear some terms that we will use 
			throughout the&nbsp;article. In this part, we will give very brief introduction 
			of rule-based systems and meta-modeling.
		</P>
		<H2>Rule-Based Systems</H2>
		<P>
			So what do we mean by rule-based? In the evolution course of computing, a field 
			called artificial intelligence was developed in the 70s&nbsp;and 80s with an 
			aim to make computers reason like human beings. Rule-based programming paradigm 
			emerged at that time as&nbsp;ways to implement systems that appear to think and 
			reason like human beings. Examples of rule-based systems are expert systems 
			that have the knowledge of a doctor or a tax advisor and can answer complex 
			questions&nbsp;people would normally ask those professionals.
		</P>
		<P>The idea of rule-based programming is to represent a domain expert’s knowledge 
			in a form called rules. That’s why it’s called rule-based. Besides rules, 
			another important ingredient in a rule-based system is facts. Here’s an 
			example. Say John is a weather reporter who gives advice to people on TV 
			channels based on weather conditions. Here’s John’s knowledge about weather:
		</P>
		<ol>
			<li>
			If it’s a rainy day, advise people to bring umbrellas when they go out.
			<li>
				If it’s a rainy day, the road would be slippery because of the rain and hence 
				warn people to drive more carefully.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<P>How do we represent the knowledge in a rule-based system? We represent it as 
			rules and facts like this:
		</P>
		<pre>  Rule 1: If it’s a rainy day, advise people to bring umbrellas when they go out. 
  Rule 2: If the road is slippery, warn people to drive more carefully. 
  Rule 3: If it’s a rainy day, road is slippery.</pre>
		<PRE>  Fact 1: It’s a rainy day. 
  Fact 2: Road is slippery.</PRE>
		<P>Here’s how our imaginary expert system mimics the reasoning capability of 
			weather reporter John. If by looking out of the window, we see it’s raining, we 
			tell our expert system that it’s raining by asserting fact number 1. 
			Immediately the expert system tries to match the asserted fact with its three 
			rules. Rules 1 and 3 are fired because the asserted fact satisfies their 
			conditions (the <EM>if</EM> clause). When rule one is fired (a more accurate 
			term is activated), the system advises people to bring umbrella as if it were a 
			real weather reporter. Firing rule 3 asserts fact 2. And because fact 2 
			satisfies the conditions of rule 2, rule 2 is fired and the system advises 
			people to drive more carefully. All these chain reactions happen in sequence as 
			the result of asserting fact number 1.
		</P>
		<P>Although the example is nowhere close to the complexity of a practical 
			rule-based system, it shows the following key points:
		</P>
		<ol>
			<li>
			A rule-based system consists mainly of&nbsp;three things: facts, rules and an 
			engine that acts on them.
			<li>
				Rules represent knowledge and facts represent data. A rule-based system solves 
				problems by applying rules on facts (i.e. matching facts with rules’ <EM>if</EM>
			clauses).&nbsp;
			<li>
				A rule consists of two parts: conditions (<EM>if</EM>
			clauses) and actions.&nbsp;
			<li>
				The action part of a rule might assert new facts that fire other rules.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<P>Among the most popular rule engines, <STRONG>JESS (Java Expert System Shell)</STRONG>
			is probably of the most interest to Java developers. It is&nbsp;the reference 
			implementation of JSR 094 Java Rule Engine API and it has&nbsp;plug-ins to 
			support development of rule systems in Eclipse. Therefore, the rule code we 
			will see&nbsp;in this article will be&nbsp;in JESS's&nbsp;syntax. Before we 
			leave this section, it’s helpful to introduce JESS&nbsp;and take a glimpse of 
			its programming syntax. JESS is software that interprets rules and facts 
			expressed in its programming language. Just as Java is a language for 
			expressing objects and Java compiler is software that interprets Java code, 
			JESS has a language for expressing rules and facts and a compiler to interpret 
			the code. JESS is developed in Java by Ernest Friedman-Hill at Sandia National 
			Laboratories. Here’s what the rules and facts in our weather example look like 
			in JESS code.</P>
		<PRE>(defrule rule-1 (rainy-day) = &gt; (advise-people bring-umbrella))
(defrule rule-2 (road-slippery) =&gt; (advise-people drive-carefully)) 
(defrule rule-3 (rainy-day) =&gt; (assert road-slippery))
(road-slippery)
(rainy-day)</PRE>
		<P>The last two lines in the list above are the two facts. The first three lines 
			are the three rules. Rules in&nbsp;JESS&nbsp;take this form: <b><CODE>(defrule 
					rule-name conditions =&gt; actions)</CODE></b> Rules are defined using 
			the <code>defrule</code> construct. <code>rule-1</code>, <code>rule-2</code>, 
			and <code>rule-3</code> are the names of the rules respectively. <code>rule-1</code>
			has a condition: <code>(rainy-day)</code>. In this case, <code>(rainy-day)</code>
			is also called a <b>pattern</b>.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is so called&nbsp;because the 
			rule engine&nbsp;treats it as a pattern for matching facts. The pattern <code>(rainy-day)</code>
			in <code>rule-1</code> will match only one fact: the <code>(rainy-day)</code> fact 
			in the last line of the code list. When it's matched, the action <code>(advise-people 
				bring-umbrella)</code> of <code>rule-1</code> will be executed.</P>
		<P>There are a lot more to the syntax of&nbsp;a rule&nbsp;language like JESS. We 
			will only explain those necessary for following along this article. For 
			more&nbsp;details, you can refer to the documentation that comes with JESS.</P>
		<H2>Model, Meta-model, Meta-metamodel
		</H2>
		<P>Sometimes it’s helpful to the discussion if we categorize models into different 
			levels. We call a model a <b>meta-model</b> if it is used to define models. We 
			call a model a <b>meta-metamodel</b> if it is used to define meta-models.
		</P>
		<P>For example, ECore is a model. It can be a meta-model or a meta-metamodel 
			depending on how we use it. When we use ECore to define models of a purchase 
			order system, it plays the role of a meta-model. The Rule Meta Model we will 
			develop later in this article is another example of meta-model. It is a 
			meta-model because we will use it to define a model for a logical problem.
		</P>
		<P>The Rule Meta Model we will develop later is defined in ECore. In this sense, 
			ECore is a meta-metamodel because it is used to define a meta-model. Another 
			example of ECore as a meta-metamodel is EMF’s Gen Model. EMF’s Gen Model is a 
			meta-model that defines models concerning how code is generated. ECore is the 
			meta-metamodel that defines Gen Model.
		</P>
		<P>When we say model A defines model B, in a practical sense, we mean that all 
			model elements in B are instances of model elements in A. We will see this in 
			effect later when we reach the article’s example. For the purpose of this 
			article, the important facts to note are:
		</P>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Categorization of meta levels is not absolute.
			<li>
			We will use ECore as a meta-metamodel to define the Rule Meta Model.
			<li>
			Model elements in the Rule Meta Model will be instances of model elements in 
			ECore.
			<li>
			We will use the Rule Meta Model to define a model for a logical problem. 
			Elements in the model will be instances of model elements in the Rule Meta 
			Model.
			<LI>
				Meta-metamodels are also referred to as M3 models; meta-models as M2 models; 
				models like a bank application model as M1 models.
			</LI>
		</ol>
		<H2>Problem Statement
		</H2>
		<P>The logical problem&nbsp;we will solve with this article’s Rule Meta Model is 
			this:
		</P>
		<P>There are four boxes, labeled from 1 to 4. We have four balls in four colors: 
			red, blue, green and yellow. Our task is to put one ball in each box according 
			to the following three constraints.
		</P>
		<ol>
			<li>
			If red ball is in box 1, blue ball must be in box 3.
			<li>
			If yellow ball is not in box 2, green ball must be in box 3.
			<li>
				Green ball cannot be in box 4 and Red ball cannot be in box 2.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<H2>Set up Environment and Run the Example Code
		</H2>
		
<P>The solution to the problem is in <A href="RuleMetaModel.zip">RuleMetaModel.zip</A> 
  and <A href="BallPlacementRuleModel.zip">BallPlacementRuleModel.zip</A> that come 
  with this article. The code in the zip files requires the following software. 
</P>
		
<PRE>Java Runtime or SDK (The one I use is Java SDK 1.4.2 from Sun Microsystems) 
Eclipse (The version I use is Eclipse SDK 3.0) 
EMF (The version I use is EMF SDK 2.0.1 RC2)
JESS 7.0a1</PRE>
		
<P>Installing JESS is simple.&nbsp;You can download JESS&nbsp;from <A href="http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/download.shtml" target="_blank"> 
  http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/download.shtml</A>. Then unzip the downloaded&nbsp;file 
  to a folder, add jess.jar to your java classpath and you are ready to go. JESS 
  is not free software. After clicking the link above, you’ll be asked to enter 
  your name, company and email. After that, you’ll be taken to the page where 
  you can download various versions of JESS. The one to download for this article 
  is trial version 7.01a1. This version of JESS comes with some Eclipse plug-ins 
  for editing JESS code in the Eclipse IDE. Those plug-ins are not needed for 
  running the code of this article. Installing them is optional. </P>
		
<P>To install and run the example for this article, unzip <A href="RuleMetaModel.zip">RuleMetaModel.zip</A> 
  into your <I>plugins/ </I>subdirectory. This zip&nbsp;file contains three plug-ins. 
  They are the model, edit, editor plug-ins EMF generates for our Rule Meta Model. 
  The other zip file, <A href="BallPlacementRuleModel.zip">BallPlacementRuleModel.zip</A>, 
  contains two files: <code>BallPlacement.rulemetamodel</code> and <code>BallPlacement.clp</code>. 
  <code>BallPlacement.rulemetamodel</code> is the model that models our logical 
  problem. It is defined using Rule Meta Model. The other file <code>BallPlacement.clp</code> 
  is JESS code generated from <code>BallPlacement.rulemetamodel</code>. Below 
  is a pictorial view of all the components in the two zip files and how they 
  relate to EMF and rule engine.</P>
		<P><b>Figure 1. Overall picture of the example code.</b></P>
		<P><IMG alt="" src="images/Overall.gif"></P>
		<P>
		</P>
		
<P>We will explain each component as we go along. For now, since we already have 
  JESS rule engine set up, let's run <code>BallPlacement.clp</code> through the 
  JESS rule engine (the yellow part in Figure 1). Assume that you unzipped the 
  two files in <code>BallPlacementRuleModel.zip</code> to <code>C:\</code> and 
  that <code> jess.jar</code> is in your java classpath. Here is the command to 
  run <code>BallPlacement.clp</code> through the JESS rule engine: </P>
		<P><IMG height="13" src="images/tryit.gif" width="61"> <code>java jess.Main 
				C:\BallPlacement.clp</code></P>
		<P>The result you will see in the command console will look like the screenshot 
			below. Dumping the result to a console window like this is not pretty but it 
			serves our purpose just fine. The last four&nbsp;facts listed in the screenshot 
			are solutions to the logical problem. That is, out of the 24 possible 
			placements of the balls in the boxes, only&nbsp;four placements satisfy the 
			three constraints posed by our problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
		<P><IMG alt="" src="images/BallPlacementResult.gif"></P>
		<H2>BallPlacement.clp
		</H2>
		<P>Before we look more closely at the Rule Meta Model and Ball Placement Model, 
			let’s see what constitutes a rule language by taking a look at <code>BallPlacement.clp</code>
			first. This knowledge will help us make sense of the meta-model and model 
			later. <code>BallPlacement.clp</code> defines two fact templates: <IMG height="13" src="images/tag_1.gif" width="24" align="center">&nbsp;<code>placement</code>
			and <IMG height="13" src="images/tag_2.gif" width="24" align="center">&nbsp;<code>ball</code>.&nbsp;
		</P>
		<PRE><IMG height=13 src="images/tag_1.gif" width=24 align=center>(deftemplate placement 
	(slot box_one)
	(slot box_two)
	(slot box_three)
	(slot box_four)) 
	
<IMG height=13 src="images/tag_2.gif" width=24 align=center>(deftemplate ball (slot color))</PRE>
		<P>A <b>fact template</b> as its name suggests is a template of facts and is 
			defined by the <code>deftemplate</code> construct in JESS. Earlier we wrote the 
			weather fact like this: <code>(rainy-day)</code>. If we want to specify 
			temperature in addition to weather, we’ll probably write a fact like this: <code>(rainy-day 
				50F)</code>. Facts like these are called <b>ordered facts</b> because they 
			require their elements to be in a specific order. <code>(rainy-day 50F)</code> is 
			a different fact from <code>(50F rainy-day)</code> because the elements are in 
			a different order. Sometimes it’s desirable to have some structure in the way 
			we state facts so that we can express elements in a fact regardless of their 
			positions. This is where fact templates come into play. With fact templates, we 
			can state facts like this: <code>(weather-report (weather rainy-day) (temperature 
				50F))</code>. We say that the <code>weather-report</code> fact has two <b>slots</b>:
			<code>weather</code> and <code>temperature</code>. Slot <code>weather</code> has 
			a value of <code>rainy-day</code> and slot <code>temperature</code> has a value 
			of <code>50F</code>. It doesn’t matter if you put the <code>temperature</code> slot 
			before or after the <code>weather</code> slot. Facts like this are called <b>unordered 
				facts</b> because the order of their elements is not relevant.
		</P>
		<P>In our example, the <code>placement</code> fact template defines four slots, one 
			for each box. The <code>ball</code> fact template defines one slot: <code>color</code>. 
			With these two fact templates, we can state the fact that "green ball is in box 
			one"&nbsp;in JESS language like this: <code>(placement (box_one Green))</code>. 
			Besides fact templates, <code>BallPlacement.clp</code> has&nbsp;a 
			few&nbsp;rules. Here's the rule that describes the first constraint about ball 
			placement.</P>
		<pre>(defrule placement_constraint1 
<IMG height=13 src="images/tag_1.gif" width=24 align=center>	?placement &lt;-  (placement (box_one ?box_one) (box_two ?box_two) (box_three ?box_three) (box_four ?box_four))  
<IMG height=13 src="images/tag_2.gif" width=24 align=center>	(and (placement (box_one ?box_one&amp;Red) (box_two ?box_two) (box_three ?box_three) (box_four ?box_four))  
	(placement (box_one ?box_one) (box_two ?box_two) (box_three ?box_three&amp;~Blue) (box_four ?box_four))) 
=&gt; 
<IMG height=13 src="images/tag_3.gif" width=24 align=center> 
	(retract ?placement))</pre>
		<P>
			We have seen rules in the weather report metaphor.&nbsp;We know <code>placement_constraint1</code>
			is the name of the&nbsp;rule. <IMG height="13" src="images/tag_1.gif" width="24" align="center">&nbsp;<IMG height="13" src="images/tag_2.gif" width="24" align="center">&nbsp;are 
			the conditions of the rule and <IMG height="13" src="images/tag_3.gif" width="24" align="center">&nbsp;is 
			the action. Condition <IMG height="13" src="images/tag_1.gif" width="24" align="center">&nbsp;assigns&nbsp;what 
			looks like a&nbsp;pattern to the <code>?placement</code> variable. In fact, 
			what actually gets assigned to the <code>?placement</code> variable is a fact 
			that matches the pattern. In JESS, variable names start with <EM>?</EM> . <code>?box_one</code>,
			<code>?box_two</code> in the code list above&nbsp;are all variables. Variables 
			are not typed. You can assign strings, integers, facts and values of other data 
			types to them. Assigning a value to a variable is usually done through the <code>bind</code>
			function like this:
		</P>
		<P><code>(bind ?variable "some string value")</code></P>
		<P>However, using <code>bind</code> function to assign a value to a variable is an 
			action not a condition.&nbsp;That's why in&nbsp;<IMG height="13" src="images/tag_1.gif" width="24" align="center">,&nbsp;instead 
			of using the <code>bind</code> function in the condition part of a rule, we 
			use&nbsp;a special form called <b>pattern binding</b> <code>&lt;-</code> to 
			assign a fact to the <code>?placement</code> variable.&nbsp;
		</P>
		<P>Condition <IMG height="13" src="images/tag_2.gif" width="24" align="center">&nbsp;has 
			two fact matching patterns enclosed in a logical <code>and</code>. The logical <code>
				and</code> is called a <b>conditional element</b> in a rule 
			language.&nbsp;Don't worry if the two conditions&nbsp;still look cryptic. Let's 
			mimic the reasoning process of a rule engine and you will see how&nbsp;the 
			conditions&nbsp;function.&nbsp;Let's see what happens if we put&nbsp;the 
			following fact in the rule engine:</P>
		<P><code>(placement (box_one Red) (box_two Blue) (box_three Green) (box_four Yellow))</code></P>
		<P>The rule engine tries to see if the fact satisfies the two conditions of <code>placement_constraint1</code>. 
			It first tries to match the fact with the pattern in <IMG height="13" src="images/tag_1.gif" width="24" align="center">.&nbsp;The 
			pattern in <IMG height="13" src="images/tag_1.gif" width="24" align="center">&nbsp;has 
			one variable in each of the four slots of&nbsp;the <code>placement</code> fact.&nbsp;That 
			means the pattern matches any value in those four slots.&nbsp;So the fact 
			satisfies the first condition and <code>Red</code> is assigned to <code>?box_one</code>,
			<code>Blue</code> to <code>?box_two</code>, <code>Green</code> to <code>?box_three</code>
			and <code>Yellow</code> to <code>?box_four</code>.
		</P>
		<P>But this is not enough to trigger the execution of <code>placement_constraint1</code>'s 
			action. The rule engine sees that there's a second condition in the rule. So it 
			tries to see if the same fact matches the second condition's patterns. The 
			first pattern in&nbsp;<IMG height="13" src="images/tag_2.gif" width="24" align="center">&nbsp;says 
			that <code>box_one</code> must be&nbsp;<code>?box_one</code> and <code>Red</code>
			(<code>?box_one&amp;Red</code>) and the other three slots can have any values 
			that are assigned to the three variables <code>?box_two</code>, <code>?box_three</code>
			and <code>?box_four</code> respectively. The rule engine already knows from the 
			first condition that <code>?box_one</code> is <code>Red</code>. So <code>(?box_one&amp;Red)</code>
			is no contradiction (Red is Red). The fact satisfies the first pattern of <IMG height="13" src="images/tag_2.gif" width="24" align="center">. 
			Because of the <code>and</code> conditional element, the&nbsp;second pattern 
			in&nbsp;<IMG height="13" src="images/tag_2.gif" width="24" align="center">&nbsp;needs 
			to&nbsp;match the fact&nbsp;too for the whole condition to be considered 
			satisfied. The second pattern in <IMG height="13" src="images/tag_2.gif" width="24" align="center">&nbsp;says 
			that <code>box_three</code> must be&nbsp;<code>?box_three</code> and not <code>Blue</code>
			(<code>?box_three&amp;~Blue</code>) and the other three slots can have any 
			values that are assigned to&nbsp;the three variables <code>?box_one</code>, <code>?box_two</code>
			and <code>?box_four</code> respectively. The rule engine already know from the 
			first condition that <code>?box_three</code> is <code>Green</code>. So <code>(?box_three&amp;~Blue)</code>
			is no contradiction (Green is not Blue). The fact satisfies the&nbsp;second 
			pattern of <IMG height="13" src="images/tag_2.gif" width="24" align="center">&nbsp;as 
			well.</P>
		<P>So all conditions are satisfied. The action of <code>placement_constraint1</code>
			will execute because of the assertion of the fact. What the action does is 
			remove the matching fact from the rule engine. Why? Because all placement facts 
			that satisfy the conditions of any one of the three constraint rules in <code>BallPlacement.clp</code>
			are not solutions to our logical problem. We remove them from the rule engine's 
			fact list so that the ones remaining will be our solutions.</P>
		<H2>Rule Meta Model
		</H2>
		<P>Now that we know the basic constructs such as <EM>patterns</EM>, <EM>actions</EM>,
			<EM>rules</EM>, <EM>facts</EM> of a rule language, it's time to see how we 
			model them in a meta-model; that is, the blue part in Figure 1. Our Rule Meta 
			Model consists of a package, a few data types, enumerations and classes. As we 
			said earlier,&nbsp;Rule Meta Model is defined in ECore and by that we mean all 
			model elements in&nbsp;Rule Meta Model are instances of model elements in 
			ECore. The one and only package in the Rule Meta Model is an instance of 
			ECore’s <code>EPackage</code>; the data types instances of ECore’s <code>EDataType</code>; 
			the enumerations instances of ECore’s <code>EEnum</code> and the classes 
			instances of ECore’s <code>EClass</code>.
		</P>
		<P>Below is a screenshot of how Rule Meta Model looks like in Eclipse. In the 
			following sections, we'll go through the data types, enumerations and classes 
			one by one.&nbsp;
		</P>
		<P><b>Figure 2. Rule Meta Model.</b></P>
		<P><IMG alt="" src="images/RuleMetaModel.gif"></P>
		<H4>Data Types
		</H4>
		<P>
			Unlike Java, a rule language is untyped. In the code&nbsp;excerpt of <code>BallPlacement.clp</code>
			in previous section, we don’t see the types of <code>ball</code>, <code>color</code>, 
			and <code>placement</code>. Although the language itself is untyped, underneath 
			the language in the rule engine, things are still typed. For example, <code>ball</code>,
			<code>color</code>, <code>placement</code> are of a type called <code>Symbol</code>. 
			Values like <code>"something"</code> are of type <code>String</code> and values 
			like <code>2.3</code> are of type <code>Float</code>. Types like <code>Symbol</code>,
			<code>String</code>, and <code>Float</code> are called <b>primitive types</b> or
			<b>data types</b>. Most rule languages support a common set of primitive types. 
			However, there are types available in one language but you don’t see them in 
			others. It's&nbsp;important&nbsp;not to confuse data types like <code>String</code>
			and <code>Float</code> in a rule language&nbsp;with similar data types <code>java.lang.String</code>
			and <code>java.lang.Float</code> in java. They are totally different types used 
			in different languages interpreted by different virtual machines. Types in a 
			rule language are interpreted by a rule engine whereas java types are 
			interpreted by a Java virtual machine. This is why when we model these data 
			types in the Rule Meta model, we cannot simply use <code>java.lang.String</code>
			or <code>java.lang.Float</code> but need to implement our own types.
		</P>
		<P>
			There are six data types in Rule Meta Model. Each of them corresponds to a java 
			class. You can tell which java class a data type corresponds to by 
			looking&nbsp;at the screenshot in Figure 2 or at the <code>Instance Class Name</code>
			property of the <code>EDataType</code> instance that defines the data type. The 
			table below summarizes the correspondences.

		</P>
		<P>When defining&nbsp;data types, besides implementing corresponding java classes, 
			it's often appropriate and necessary to&nbsp;overwrite the generated code 
			for&nbsp;converting strings&nbsp;to and from&nbsp;instances of the data types. 
			In our example, we overwrite <code>createRSymbolFromString()</code> in <code>com.example.rule.ecore.rulemetamodel.impl.RulemetamodelFactoryImpl.java</code>
			for <code>RSymbol</code> and other five similar methods in the same file for 
			the other five data types.
		</P>
		<P>A meta model like ours should be as platform independent as possible. We don't 
			want&nbsp;to tailor &nbsp;Rule Meta Model too much to a rule language that 
			models conforming to the Rule Meta Model can only generate code for&nbsp;that 
			specific language.&nbsp;A complete Rule Meta Model should&nbsp;model data 
			types&nbsp;common to most popular rule languages. Data types proprietary to a 
			specific rule language can be modeled at M1 level. Because the example code for 
			this article is more a demonstration than a full-fledged product, the set of 
			data types we model here is&nbsp;by no means&nbsp;complete for a rule language, 
			nor are the&nbsp;java classes implementing those data types.
		</P>
		<H4>Enumerations,&nbsp;Classes
		</H4>
		<P>There are three enumerations in the Rule Meta Model: <code>RRuleType</code>, <code>RFunctionType</code>,
			<code>RCondElemEnum</code>. The&nbsp;three enumerations and six data types are 
			used in the definition of classes in Rule Meta Model. For example, the 
			following diagram shows that class <code>RFactTemplate</code> has one attribute <code>
				factName</code> whose type is <code>RSymbol</code>, one of the data types 
			we just defined. Besides attribute <code>factName</code>, <code>RFactTemplate</code>
			also has a containment reference to zero or multiple instances of <code>RFactSlot</code>.
			<code>RFactTemplate</code> models fact templates in a rule language. The class 
			definition we see here is in line with our previous knowledge of fact 
			templates: a fact template has a name&nbsp;and defines zero or multiple slots. 
			As to <code>RFactSlot</code>, it models slots in fact templates. It has an 
			attribute <code>slotName</code> of type <code>RSymbol</code> and an attribute <code>
				slotValueRange</code> of type <code>RMultiField</code>. We know from 
			previous section that a slot has a name. What we didn't mention is that some 
			rule languages allow you to specify the legitimate values&nbsp;of a slot, which 
			is what <code>slotValueRange</code> is for.
		</P>
		<P><IMG alt="" src="images/ClassDiagram2.gif"></P>
		<p>The diagram below shows some more classes and their relations to&nbsp;each 
			other. Class <code>RRule</code> models rules. It has an attribute <code>ruleName</code>
			that represents the name of a rule; a containment reference <code>condition</code>
			that represents conditional elements in a rule's condition part; a containment 
			reference <code>ceMatchPattern</code> that represents patterns in a rule's 
			condition part but not enclosed in conditional elements; and a reference <code>actions</code>
			that represents a rule's action part.</p>
		<P>Class <code>RCondElem</code> models conditional elements. A conditional element 
			can contain match patterns or more conditional elements. That's why&nbsp;our 
			definition of <code>RCondElem</code> has one containment reference to itself 
			and one containment reference to <code>RPattern</code>. The <code>ceName</code> 
			attribute of <code>RCondElem</code> denotes what conditional element (<code>and</code>,
			<code>or</code>, <code>not</code>, etc) an instance of <code>RCondElem</code> is. 
			If you look at <code>RCondElemEnum</code>, the type of the <code>ceName</code> attribute, 
			you will see that there are three enumeration literals there: <code>and</code>, <code>
				or</code>, <code>not</code>. For the same reason we don't define a complete 
			set of data types, the list of conditional elements in <code>RCondElemEnum</code>
			is not complete and in a more complete meta-model,&nbsp;<code>RCondElemEnum</code>
			should include conditional elements&nbsp;common in most popular rule languages.</P>
		<P>Class <code>RFunction</code> models functions.&nbsp;A function like <code>(retract 
				(?placement))</code> we saw earlier has a name and takes zero or 
			multiple&nbsp;instances of primitive data types as parameters. In this case, <code>retract</code>
			is the name of the function and <code>?placement</code> is a parameter. 
			Although not visible, the <code>retract</code> function returns a value. In 
			JESS, it returns the symbol <code>TRUE</code> if it successfully removes a 
			fact. In our definition of <code>RFunction</code>, we have an attribute <code>functionName</code>
			to represent the name of a function; an attribute <code>returnValue</code> of 
			type <code>RDataType</code> to represent a function's return value; a reference 
			to instances of <code>RDataType</code> to represent a function's parameters. 
			The <code>functionType</code> attribute in <code>RFunction</code> denotes 
			whether the function is provided by the rule engine or defined by users.</P>

		<H2>Ball Placement Rule Model</H2>
		<P>
			With the three plug-ins of Rule Meta Model&nbsp;in place,&nbsp;we can now use 
			it to model our logical problem. Let's&nbsp;launch Eclipse and create a new 
			project. Select <code>File -&gt; New -&gt; Project</code> and in the popup 
			dialog, select <code>Simple -&gt; Project</code> Click <code>Next</code> button 
			and name the project <code>Test</code> or anything you like. With a project in 
			place, we can now create a rule model or import <code>BallPlacement.rulemetamodel</code>
			that comes with this article's example code.</P>
		<P>To creat the model from scratch, right click on the project we just created and 
			in the popup context menu, select <code>New -&gt; Other</code>. And then in the 
			popup window, select <code>Example EMF Model Creation Wizards -&gt; Rulemetamodel 
				Model</code> and click the <code>Next</code> button. In the next screen, 
			name the model whatever you like&nbsp;but keep&nbsp;the file extension&nbsp;as <code>
				.rulemetamodel</code>.&nbsp;Click the <code>Next</code> button to go to the 
			next screen, and select <code>RModule</code> from the top dropdown box. Then 
			click the <code>Finish</code> button.</P>
		<P>To import <code>BallPlacement.rulemetamodel</code>,&nbsp;right click on&nbsp;the 
			project we just created and in the popup context menu, select <code>Import</code>. 
			In the popup dialog window, select <code>File System</code> and click <code>Next</code>
			button. The <code>Import</code> dialog window will show up. Use the <code>browse</code>
			button in the dialog window to select the folder where 
			you&nbsp;unzipped&nbsp;the files in <code>BallPlacementRuleModel.zip</code>. A 
			list of files in that folder will show up in the <code>Import</code> dialog 
			window. Check <code>BallPlacement.rulemetamodel</code> in the list and click 
			the <code>Finish</code> button.
		</P>
		<P>If you create the model from scratch, you can refer to <code>BallPlacement.rulemetamodel</code>
			for details of&nbsp;the model's elements. Below is a screenshot of how the 
			model looks like in Eclipse. It has two fact templates: <code>placement</code> and
			<code>ball</code>. It has three&nbsp;rules for the three&nbsp;constraints posed 
			in the logical problem. It&nbsp;has two&nbsp;other rules for putting initial 
			facts into rule engine. Without facts,&nbsp;the rule engine will have nothing 
			to apply the three constraint rules to. The model also has some&nbsp;functions. 
			They are used in&nbsp;the action part of the rules.&nbsp;</P>

		<P>If you select the <code>RModule</code> node in <code>BallPlacement.rulemetamodel</code> and 
			see its property view, you'll see that there's property called <code>Output File 
				Path</code>. The value of this property is where the model puts the 
			generated code. Please change its value to an appropriate location on your 
			computer and then right click on the <code>RModule</code> node. In the popup 
			context menu, select <code>Generate</code> and check your file system to see if 
			a file by the name you specified in the <code>Output File Path</code> property 
			is generated. The generated file should be the same as <code>BallPlacement.clp</code>
			in <code>BallPlacementRuleModel.zip</code>.</P>
		<P>The logic for generating rule language code from a rule model is in a JET (Java 
			Emitter Templates) template and a java helper class. The JET template file is <code>
				Module.clpjet</code> in the <code>templates</code> folder of <code>com.example.rule.ecore</code>
			project, which can be&nbsp;unzipped from <code>RuleMetaModel.zip</code>. The 
			java helper class is <code>com.example.rule.ecore.templates.ModuleHelper.java</code>. 
			Readers unfamiliar with JET can refer to <A href="../Article-JET/jet_tutorial1.html">
				JET Tutorial Part 1 (Introduction to JET)</A> and <A href="../Article-JET2/jet_tutorial2.html">
				JET Tutorial Part 2 (Write Code that Writes Code)</A> for an excellent and 
			very readable guide.</P>
		<P>Practically, a generation model might be necessary for storing complex settings 
			that govern the generation of rule language code from a rule model just like 
			EMF's Gen Model for generating code from ECore models. For simplicity, we 
			modified the editor plug-in EMF generated from our Rule Meta Model and provide 
			a menu option in the context menu that pops up when you right click&nbsp;the <code>RModule</code>
			node.
		</P>
		<H2>Conclusion</H2>
		<P>We have demonstrated how to define a meta-model with EMF, use the meta-model to 
			define a model for a logical problem and use JET to generate rule language code 
			from the model. We have also seen that the generated code correctly solves the 
			non-trivial logical problem. The flexibility of EMF as well as Eclipse makes 
			all the work a breeze. The EMF framework has all modeling foundation there and 
			thanks to that, most of our time is spent in understanding&nbsp;rule languages 
			and how rule engine works.&nbsp;</P>
		<P>The example code for this article is a demonstration. There are many things to 
			improve. Modeling rule-based systems is still a field in progress. There are 
			standards bodies working on specifications. In the Reference section at the end 
			of this article, we provide some pointers to relevant OMG&nbsp;standards in 
			progress&nbsp;such as Production Rule Representation RFP and Sridhar Iyengar's 
			response to OMG's Business Rules in Models RFI. Also listed in the Reference 
			section is a very popular rule engine called CLIPS, of which JESS and many 
			other rule engines are variations.</P>
