		The Rich Client Platform (RCP) allows you to build Java
		applications that can compete with native applications on any
		platform. Part 1 of the tutorial introduced you to the platform
		and the steps used to build the smallest possible RCP program.
		In part 2 we'll look at what we did in more detail and introduce
		some of the configuration classes that let you take control of
		much of the layout and functionality of an RCP application. This
		part has been updated for Eclipse 3.1.2.
