		This article presents a brief branch and merge scenario designed
		to quickly illustrate some branch and merge features of
		Eclipse's CVS integration. I assume the reader already
		appreciates the value of branching and merging in a source
		control environment. Little is said to justify it here. Rather,
		a step-by-step scenario illustrates the common branch and merge
		operations using Eclipse-based IDEs with CVS as the source
		control mechanism.
