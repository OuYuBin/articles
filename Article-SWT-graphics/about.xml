		The package <code>org.eclipse.swt.graphics</code> contains 
		classes that allow management of graphics resources. Graphics 
		can be drawn on anything that implements 
		<code>org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Drawable</code>, which includes 
		<code>org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Control</code> and 
		<code>org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Image</code>. The class 
		<code>org.eclipse.swt.graphics.GC</code> encapsulates all of 
		the drawing API, including how to draw lines and shapes, draw 
		text and images and fill shapes. This article shows how to use 
		a GC to draw onto an Image, or onto a control through its 
		paintEvent callback. The Canvas control, specifically designed 
		for drawing operations, has a number of constructor style bits
		that allow you to determine when and how painting 
		occurs, and the article shows how to use these.
