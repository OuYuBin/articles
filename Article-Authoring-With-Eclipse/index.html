			The authors of this document view technical documentation as

			In the open source world, technical documentation is
			primarily accomplished using two popular formats: DocBook
			and the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). These two
			formats share two important characteristics: they are both
			systems for creating structured documents using XML and both focus on content that is written
			in plain text (or in an editor such as OpenOffice). In this
			article we focus on DocBook because of our familiarity with the
			format. However, we will also provide complementary DITA
			information where appropriate.

			The technical documentation process can be broken down into
			three broad stages: creation, review, and publication.
		</p><p>
			Creation simply refers to populating a document with
			content that adheres to whatever format you choose to write
			against. This document is usually edited using an XML editor
			of choice, although it can be edited with any text editor as
			well. In this article we will use WTP's XML editor to edit
			documents.
		</p><p>
			Once an initial version of the content has been written, it
			is typically handed off to one or more trusted colleagues
			for review. The role of these reviewers is to ensure
			technical accuracy and improve the quality of the writing.
			The comments and suggestions gathered from the review stage
			are then used by the document's authors to create a final
			revision of the document.
		</p><p>
			The final revision of a document involves making it is ready for
			publication. When authoring in an XML format, you must eventually transform the document
			must be transformed from XML to a human-readable format
			(that is, one that has both style and formatting applied)
			such as HTML or PDF. Once in a human-readable format, the
			document is ready to be published by a selected publisher.
		</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N10088"></a>Advantages of an XML format</h3></div></div></div><p>
				Before diving into an actual example of the technical
				documentation process using Eclipse, let's take a look
				at some of the benefits of authoring in an XML format.
			</p><p>
				There are four advantages to authoring in XML that
				really show the benefit of this format: modularity,
				version control, consistent formatting, and publishing
				to multiple formats.
			</p><p>
				<span class="emphasis"><em>Modularity</em></span>
				<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
							XML formats such as DocBook and DITA are
							modular. This allows you to break up your
							documents into multiple sections, which can
							be automatically combined into one document
							using transformation during the publication
							stage. Modularizing your documents can be
							very beneficial when working on large
							documents, such as a book, or when working
							with multiple authors. As an example, the 
							book <span class="emphasis"><em>Java Web
							Application Development with Eclipse</em></span> (set to
							be published in time for EclipseCon 2006),
							was written in DocBook. The book
							was structured with one table of
							contents XML file and a separate file for
							each chapter. Of course, it's up to you to
							determine the structure that works best for
							your project. The key is that by using an
							XML format, you have the freedom to configure
							your document's structure.
						</li></ul></div>

				<span class="emphasis"><em>Version Control</em></span>
				<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
							Version control is very useful and has
							become a staple in most development
							processes. Why is it, then, that a system that
							allows you to maintain the complete history
							of your files, allowing you to revert to a
							previous version at any time, is not part of
							the authoring process? One reason is that many
							documents are authored using word-processing
							tools that mix formatting information and
							content, such as <span class="trademark">Microsoft</span>&reg; Word or Corel
							WordPerfect. This mix results in files
							containing many changes between revisions,
							reducing the usefulness of version control
							because it is difficult to view the relevant
							changes between versions of the document.
							XML formats do not suffer from this problem
							as they are content-specific. Authoring in
							an XML format allows you to use a version
							control system and reap the benefits that
							go with it.
						</li></ul></div>

				<span class="emphasis"><em>Consistent Formatting</em></span>
				<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
							Ensuring that your document is consistently
							formatted is a time-consuming aspect of the
							authoring process. This task can be further
							aggravated when the authoring format
							mixes content and formatting in one document
							or when working with multiple authors or
							files. One of the typical final steps in the
							authoring process is ensuring that your
							document uses consistent formatting. Using
							an XML format solves the consistent
							formatting problem by separating your
							document's content from its formatting. In
							the XML case, formatting can be applied
							uniformly to your entire document using a
							style sheet. An XML format saves you time and
							guarantees consistent formatting.
						</li></ul></div>

				<span class="emphasis"><em>Publishing to Multiple Formats</em></span>
				<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
							By separating your document's
							formatting from its content, you gain
							 an enormous freedom. Documents authored
							in the XML format are not bound by one set
							of formatting rules. This means that you can
							author an article, such as this one, and
							create an HTML version, a PDF version, and
							even an Eclipse help system version simply
							by transforming your document with different
							style sheets. In fact, DocBook includes all
							three of these style sheets allowing you to
							easily publish to any of the formats listed
							above.
						</li></ul></div>
			</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N100B8"></a>Examples</h2></div></div></div><p>
			To show the authoring tool chain in Eclipse, this article
			will use a sample book document from the DocBook XSL project. The
			XML version of the document can be seen
			<a href="files/book.xml" target="_new">here</a>. This DocBook source for this
			article is also available and can be seen <a href="article.xml" target="_new">here</a>.
		</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="N100C5"></a>Tool Chain</h3></div></div></div><p>
				A tool chain is a set of tools that are used to create a
				more complex tool or product. The tools may be used in a
				chain, so the output of each tool becomes the input of
				the next
				[<a href="#toolchain">3</a>]
				. This concept should be very familiar to those who work
				on the <span class="trademark">UNIX</span>&reg;, 
				<span class="trademark">Linux</span>&reg;, and 
				<span class="trademark">AIX</span>&reg; platforms, 
				for example, where the output of one command
				line tool is typically piped to the next tool, allowing
				complex operations to be performed using several simple
				tools.
			</p><p>
				The beginning of our technical publishing tool chain is
				the WTP XML editor, which we use to edit our content.
				After we have finished editing the content, we will feed the
				output of what we edited into OrangeVolt, an XSLT
				transformation engine, which will use style sheets to
				publish the content into a human-readable format.
			</p><p>
				The limitation we put on these examples is that our
				tool chain, including all three stages, creation, review,
				and publication, will be built with tools available within
				Eclipse. From our experience, Eclipse has enormous
				potential as an integrated documentation
				development environment. In the following sections, we'll
				discuss how you can make this a reality with current
				Eclipse tooling and where the tooling falls short.
			</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="N100DD"></a>Creation and Review</h4></div></div></div><p>
					Although creation and review are two separate parts
					of the technical documentation process, the same
					tools are required and therefore will be discussed
					together.
				</p><p>
					As you may already know, the Eclipse project
					is composed of serveral top-level projects including
					Eclipse itself (known as the Eclipse base) and the
					WTP project. WTP adds many tools to the Eclipse base
					including an XML editor with graphical and source
					representations of the content. Although the
					graphical editor is useful for viewing your document,
					we've found that the source editor, shown in
					<a href="#xml-source-editor" title="Figure&nbsp;1.&nbsp;The XML Source Editor">Figure&nbsp;1, &ldquo;The XML Source Editor&rdquo;</a>
					, is more useful when authoring in XML.
				</p><div class="figure"><a name="xml-source-editor"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;1.&nbsp;The XML Source Editor</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" border="0" width="807"><tr style="height: 598px"><td><img src="images/xmlsourceeditor.gif" width="807" alt="The XML Source Editor"></td></tr></table></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
					The XML editor provides many of the Eclipse

					Aside from the benefits of the XML editor, working
					in Eclipse provides other benefits. Eclipse includes
					integrated version control for CVS. (There is also a
					freely available plug-in for subversion
					[<a href="#subversion">6</a>], another version control 
					system.) Integrated
					version control allows you to check your changes
					into, and view others' changes in, your version
					control system from within Eclipse. These tools are
					also useful for your reviewers, who, if you give them
					permission, can add comments and suggestions to your
					document and check their changes in. Giving your reviewers
					permission to make these changes allows you to avoid
					the need to use e-mail or some other communication
					mechanism.

					The DocBook XSL
					[<a href="#docbookxsl">1</a>]

						Transforming a DocBook XML file to PDF format is
						more involved than the transformation to HTML
						but it is still possible using a style sheet. The
						difference lies in a task that must be performed
						before the actual transformation. So, the
						transformation from XML to PDF is a two-step
						process.
					</p><p>
						Step one is to generate an XSL formatting objects
						(XSL-FO) document. This document will then be
						transformed into a PDF. In order to generate an
						XSL-FO document, you need to use the following
						stylesheet:
						<span class="emphasis"><em>fo/docbook.xsl</em></span>.

						Step two is to use a Formatting Objects
						Processor (FOP) to transform your XSL-FO
						document into a PDF. One of the more popular
						open source FOPs is the
						<a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/" target="_new">
							Apache FOP
						</a>
						. We'll use a third-party
						<a href="http://www.ahmadsoft.org/fopbridge.html" target="_new">
							plug-in from Ahmadsoft
						</a>
						that integrates Apache FOP into Eclipse. After
						installing this plug-in, all that you need to do
						to render the XSL-FO document is run the FOP
						transformation.

							</a>. An Ant script is a popular method of
							performing the publishing stage, and this
							example should give you a good starting
							point if you'd prefer to go this route. The
							DITA project already includes an Ant script
							(found in ant/sample_pdf.xml in DITA-OT) to perform

					Although we have shown that Eclipse's current XML
					authoring support is pretty good, there are a two
					noteworthy limitations.
				</p><p>
					The first is grammar and spell-checking. While these
					tools are commonplace in word-processing software,
					they do not yet exist for WTP's XML editor.
				</p><p>
					The second is a WYSIWYG editor for XML documentation
					formats such as DITA and DocBook (or a preview
					window). The lack of a sophisticated editor or a way
					to preview what you've written requires that you
					stop authoring and transform your document in order
					to view the results of your changes.
				</p><p>
					While neither of these limitations has been a show-stopper 
					in our authoring process, our hope is that as
					Eclipse is recognized as an integrated documentation
					development environment, these limitations will be
					addressed.
