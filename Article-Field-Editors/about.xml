		Even though preference pages can be simple to program, you can
		spend a lot of time getting them "just right." Field editors
		make this task faster and easier by providing the behavior for
		storing, loading, and validating preferences. Field editors also
		define some of the behavior for grouping and laying out widgets
		on a preference page.
