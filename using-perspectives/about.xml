		In the Eclipse Platform a Perspective determines the visible
		actions and views within a window. Perspectives also go well
		beyond this by providing mechanisms for task oriented
		interaction with resources in the Eclipse Platform,
		multi-tasking and information filtering. In this article the
		concepts behind perspectives are examined. The process for
		perspective definition, extension and instantiation will also be
		covered in detail with coding examples and sample scenarios.
