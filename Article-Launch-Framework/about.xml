		The ability to launch (run or debug) code under development is
		fundamental to an IDE. But because Eclipse is more of a tools
		platform than a tool itself, Eclipse's launching capabilities
		depend entirely on the current set of installed plug-ins. This
		article describes the API available to build launching plug-ins
		and works through developing an example launcher using this API.
