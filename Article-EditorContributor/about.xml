		Why are Eclipse desktop editors using a distinct contribution
		mechanism instead of simply doing it directly from editors?
		Eclipse platform desktop offers various ways a plug-in can
		contribute to menus and tool bars. The most natural way for
		views is to contribute directly (if you own the view, that is).
		However, editors are somewhat special - their contributors are
		registered alongside editors and contribution from editor
		instances is not allowed. This article explains why the
		difference and how editor contributors prevent renegade runtime
		footprint and improve user experience. We will also take a look
		at handling editor contributors in multi-page editors.
