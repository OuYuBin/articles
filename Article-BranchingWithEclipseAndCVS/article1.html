<h1>Branching with Eclipse and CVS, Part 1: The Basics</h1>

<div class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This article presents a brief branch-and-merge scenario designed to
quickly illustrate some branch-and-merge features of Eclipse's CVS
support. We assume the reader already appreciates the value of
branching and merging in a source control environment. This article
walks through a step-by-step scenario illustrating simple 
branch-and-merge operations using Eclipse-based IDEs with CVS as
the source control mechanism.</p>
<p>For a branch-and-merge scenario that incorporates rebasing, please
refer to <a href="article2.html">Part 2</a> of this article.  This 
article is <b>not</b> a prerequisite for Part 2.
Rather, Part 1 provides simpler branch-and-merge techniques.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
In any source control management (SCM) environment, branching is a
powerful mechanism for controlled isolation. Despite being a simple
concept, controlled isolation is often avoided in practice because of
its implementation complexities. 
This article demonstrates how to perform branching
with Eclipse's CVS support. 
The Eclipse on-line documentation covers this topic, but does not
provide an end-to-end scenario.
The intended audience is software
development professionals with an appreciation for the roles of branch
and merge techniques in SCM.
<p>
This article will employ a scenario of two programmers, Paul and Wing, 
working on separate branches of the same project. Paul will branch 
off main and
modify some files while Wing continues to work on the main branch,
also modifying files. Paul will then merge his branch back to the
main branch. In doing so, Paul will address the resulting merge
conflicts.  This flow is diagrammed below in the 
<a href="#scenario">Scenario Diagram</a>.
<p>
The process is repeated for a second iteration to demonstrate the
so-called <b>merge-again</b> scenario.  Work continues on the branch
after the first merge; then the branch is merged again later.  The
merge-again scenario requires that you keep track of when you last
merged via tags.  This will be demonstrated later in this article.
<p>
The <i><a name="scenario">Scenario Diagram</a></i> below will be referenced throughout
this article.
<p>
<center><img src="images/scenario1.jpg" alt="Elementary Branch Concept">
</center>
<p>
<a href="article2.html">Part 2</a> of this article adds the <i>rebase</i> operation 
to the scenario.
<p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
The sample will use a few text files inside a simple project. 
In order to carry out the sample yourself, you should already 
have a working connection to a CVS repository in your Eclipse 
workspace.
<p>
If possible, you should considering creating a new repository for
this scenario.  That's because tags and branches are the central
theme  of this article.  And unlike files in a CVS repository, the
tag and branch metadata are difficult to selectively remove if you 
want to start over.  It's much easier to just wipe-out the
repository and start with a new one.  If you do create your own CVS
repository for this article, see the 
<a href="article2.html#trouble">Troubleshooting section
in Part 2</a> for setting the necessary permissions on a new
CVS repository.
<p>
The setup instructions below can be expedited through importing
the <a href="brtest.zip">brtest.zip</a> into a simple project
<b>brtest</b>.
<p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Create a new simple project called <b>brtest</b>. </li>
  <li>Add a new file called <code>f1.txt</code>. Add the following
contents.
    <p>
    <table border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
          <pre>This file will only be edited by Paul

This line will be changed later.

This line will be changed after the first merge.

The rest of this file will remain the same.<br></pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Add a file called <code>f2.txt</code> with the following
contents.
    <p>
    <table border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
          <pre>This file will only be edited by Wing. 

This line will be changed later.

This line will be changed after the first merge.

The rest of this file will remain the same.</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Add a file called <code>f3trivial.txt</code> with the following
contents.
    <p>
    <table border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
          <pre>This file will be edited by Paul and Wing.

This line will be changed by Paul only.

This line will be changed by Paul only after the first merge.

This line will be left alone.

This line will be changed by Wing only.

This line will be changed by Wing only after the first merge.

The rest of this file will remain the same.</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Add a file called <code>f4conflict.txt</code> with the
following contents.
    <p>
    <table border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
          <pre>This file will be edited by Paul and Wing.

This line will be changed by both Paul and Wing.

This line will be changed by both Paul and Wing after the first merge.

The rest of this file will remain the same.</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p>
    After adding the above files to your project and checking them
    into CVS, your resource view should look something
    like the screen shot below. </p>
    <br>
    <img alt="Checked in project" src="images/checked_in_project.jpg"><br>
  </li>
</ol>
This sets up the environment for Paul. Wing will work
in her own workspace by retrieving the files from source control.
For steps on setting up a new project with source control, see the
following section in the Eclipse documentation: <b>Workbench User's
Guide &rarr; Tasks &rarr; Working in the team environment with CVS 
&rarr; Working with projects shared with CVS</b>.

<h2>Merge Method</h2>
When branching off a development stream, it is often advisable to
rebase before merging the subbranch back to the main branch. To
<b>rebase</b> means to merge the contents of the main branch to
the subbranch. If any conflicts are to be resolved, they are done
on the subbranch rather than the main branch. If the merge goes
well, the subbranch is merged to the main branch. After having
previously resolved all merge conflicts, this last merge would be
a trivial one. The advantages of taking the extra rebase step is
that it avoids having conflicts on the main branch and it keeps
the subbranch synchronized with the main branch.
This is the approach taken in <a href="article2.html">Part 2</a>.
<p>
In this article, our primary focus is the merge mechanism of
Eclipse's CVS support, not the particular branching strategy.
So here in Part 1, we stick with the branch method illustrated 
in the <a href="#scenario">Scenario Diagram</a>.

<h2>Creating the Branch</h2>
At this point, Paul and Wing have the same version of all files. It
is now time for Paul to create an independent branch on which to work.
<ol>
  <li>Right-click on the <b>brtest</b> project and select <b>Team
     &rarr; Branch ...</b>. A dialog is displayed for creating the branch
  and marking the start-point with a tag (also called a 
  <i>Version Name</i>).  Enter a branch name like <b>p1test</b>. Leave 
  the check box checked for <b>Start working in the branch</b>. Notice 
  that a start tag is automatically filled in for you called 
  <b>Root_p1test</b>.  This is the first tag labeled in the 
  <a href="#scenario">Scenario Diagram</a>.
  You may choose a different name so long as it doesn't conflict 
  with an existing CVS tag. This will mark where the branch was 
  created. It will be used later by the merge editor to determine 
  what has changed since branch creation. Click <b>OK</b>.
  <p> 
  <img src="images/makebranch.jpg" alt="Dialog for creating a new branch"/>
  <p> 
  Since you checked the box to start working in the branch, your
  workspace should already be configured to work in the branch.
  You can verify this in two ways.  By right-clicking the project 
  and selecting <b>Properties</b> and then <b>CVS</b>, you should 
  see the <i>p1test</i> in the tag field. If you have the CVS label 
  decorations enabled, you'll see the branch tag in the navigator 
  view (see below).
  <p>
  <img src="images/branchlist.jpg" alt="CVS labels indicating new branch"/> 
  
  
  <div class="note""><table class="note-table"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="[Note]" src="images/tip.gif"></td>
      <td>To enable CVS label decorations, go to <b>Window &rarr;
          Preferences</b> and navigate to <b>General &rarr; Appearance &rarr; 
          Label Decorations</b>.  Check the 'CVS' box. </td>
      </tr>
  </table>
  </div>
  <p>
  </li>
  <li>This step begins the work represented as the blue box labeled
  <b>PD1</b> in the <a href="#scenario">Scenario Diagram</a>.
  Paul will modify the first file using the <i>p1test</i> branch.
  Open the editor for <code>f1.txt</code>. Change line 3 from "This line
  will be changed later" to "This line changed in iter1." Save the
  change.
  <p>
  <li>Open the editor for <code>f3trivial.txt</code>. Change line 3
  from "This line will be changed by Paul only" to "This line changed 
  by Paul in iter1." Save the change.
  <p>
  <li>Open the editor for <code>f4conflict.txt</code>. Change line 3 
  from "This line will be changed by both Paul and Wing" to "This
  line changed by Paul in iter1." Save the change.
  <p>
  <li>Right-click on the <b>brtest</b> project and select <b>Team
  &rarr; Synchronize with Repository</b>. In the <b>Outgoing Mode</b>
  view, right-click the <b>brtest</b> project folder and select 
  <b>Commit</b>.  Enter a comment such as "First iteration changes 
  made by Paul." Note that for files that have changed, the revision 
  numbers are four digits. This is a CVS convention for branched revisions.
  <p>
  <img src="images/p1commit.jpg" alt="Paul's CVS label decorations after commit"/>
  <p>
  This commit is represented by the first red circle on the <i>p1test</i>
  branch of the Scenario Diagram.
  <p>
  <li>(<i>Optional <a name="howtotag">tag step</a>, only required 
  for the merge-again scenario</i>)  
  Paul is finished development for this iteration.  So he will
  <a name="howtotag">tag</a> this milestone with <b>P1</b>.  This
  tag will represent the base-point for the merge-again scenario.
  Right-click the 
  <b>brtest</b> project and select <b>Team &rarr; Tag as 
  Version ...</b>.
  In the dialog that arises, enter <b>P1</b> for the tag name
  and click <b>OK</b>.  This corresponds to the <b>P1</b> tag
  in the <a href="#scenario">Scenario Diagram</a>.
  <p>
 <div class="note">
 <table class="note-table"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="[Note]" src="images/tip.gif"></td>
      <td>To to verify a tag was created, change to the CVS Repository
           view and expand <b>Versions &rarr; brtest.</b>  The <b>P1</b>
           tag should be visible.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </div>
  <p>
  Now it is Wing's turn.  Her work is represented in the 
  <a href="#scenario">Scenario Diagram</a>
  by the blue box labeled <b>WD1</b>.
  <p>
  <li>Wing will make her changes in the main branch.  In her
  workspace she connects to CVS as "wing" to checkout the 
  <b>brtest</b> project from CVS.
  <p><img src="images/wingcheckout.jpg"/></p>
  She chooses the <b>brtest</b> under <b>HEAD</b>, the moniker
  CVS uses to designate the main branch.
  <p>
  Since Wing has the main branch loaded into her workspace, 
  she doesn't need to perform a branch change. As Wing, begin
  editing <code>f2.txt</code>. Change "This line will be changed later"
  to "This line changed by Wing in iter1." Save the change.
  <p>
  <li>Edit <code>f3trivial.txt</code> in Wing's workspace. Change
  line 9 from "This line will be changed by Wing only" to "This
  line changed by Wing in iter1." Save the change.
  <p>
  <li>Edit <code>f4conflict.txt</code> in Wing's workspace. Change
  line 3 from "This line will be changed by Paul and Wing" to
  "This line changed by Wing in iter1." Save the change.
  <p>
  <li>Commit Wing's changes with a comment like "First iteration 
  changes by Wing". Note her revisions numbers are all two
  digits (e.g. 1.2). That's because her new revisions occur on the main
  branch.  This commit is represented by the first red circle on the
  main branch in the <a href="#scenario">Scenario Diagram</a>.
  <p>
  <li>(<i>Optional tag step, not required anywhere.</i>) Since it is
  a good practice to tag a milestone or a recovery point, Wing tags
  this point with <b>W1</b> in the same manner as the in the
  <a href="#howtotag">previous tag</a>.  It's a good idea to tag 
  right before merging something into your branch so you can 
  recover it more easily even after a commit.
  <p>
 
 <div class="note">
 <table class="note-table"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="[Note]" src="images/tip.gif"></td>
      <td>To to verify a tag was created, change to the CVS Repository
          view and expand <b>Versions &rarr; brtest.</b>  The <b>W1</b>
          tag should be visible.</td>
    </tr>
  </table> 
  </div>

</ol>

<h2>The Merge</h2>
Now it is time for Paul to merge his changes into the main branch
where Wing's work resides.  This is designated with the <b>M1</b>
diamond in the <a href="#scenario">Scenario Diagram</a>.
<p>
<ol start="12">
  <li>The first step of the merge is to point the workspace to the
  target branch.  In our case, the target of the merge is the main 
  branch.  To switch the project contents to that of the main branch, 
  right-click on the <b>brtest</b> project in the Navigator view and 
  select <b>Replace with --&gt; Branch or Version ...</b>. You should 
  see a branch selection similar to the one below.  (If you performed 
  the optional tagging steps, you may see some of those under 
  <i>Versions</i>.  You may have to click <b>Refresh Tags</b> to see
  them all.)
  <p>
  <img src="images/branchswitch2.jpg" alt="Dialog for selecting new branch or version"/> 
  <p>
  <li>The <i>p1test</i> branch is the one Paul was working on. To
  switch back to the main branch, select <b>HEAD</b>. This is the CVS
  name for the main branch. Then click <b>OK</b>.
  <p>
  The resource view should look like the one below. Notice the version 
  numbers correspond to what Wing committed. All the version numbers 
  are two digits. The branch name is gone which implies the <i>HEAD</i>
  branch (or main).
  <p>
  <img src="images/afterswitch.jpg" alt="Resource view after switching back to main branch"/>
  <p>
  <li>Right-click on the <b>brtest</b> project and select <b>Team
  &rarr; Merge ...</b>.  Click the <b>Browse</b> button next to
  the <b>Branch or version to be merged</b> field.  Choose the
  <b>p1test</b> branch from the <b>Choose End Tag</b> dialog box.
  If you don't see the branch, you may have to click <b>Refresh
  tags</b>. Click <b>OK</b>.
  <p>
  <img src="images/mergestartpoint2.jpg" alt="Dialog for choosing a merge start point"/>
  <p>
  <li>The start tag should be filled automatically with
  <b>Root_p1test</b>.  In this case, the dialog anticipated
  correctly.  For this merge, we have elected <b>not</b> to 
  check the <b>Merge non-conflicting changes</b> checkbox.
  In the merge-again scenario, we will check it and compare
  the difference.  Click <b>Finish</b>.
  <p>
  <img src="images/mergewhat3.jpg" alt="Dialog for selecting choosing a branch to merge"/>
  
 <div class="note">
 <table class="note-table"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="[Note]" src="images/tip.gif"></td>
      <td>Instead of browsing for the end tag, you could have
      taken advantage of Content Assist (through Ctrl + Space 
      Bar) as indicated by the tiny light bulb next to the field.
    </tr>
  </table> 
  </div>
  <p>
  <li>This is where the fun begins. You will be presented with the 
  <i>Synchronize</i> view with the following merge results:
  <p>
  <img src="images/conflict1.jpg" alt="Merge tasks."/>
  <p> 
  <code>f1.txt</code> was not changed by Wing, so it will be
  locally updated without a problem.  But <code>f3trivial.txt</code> 
  and <code>f4conflict.txt</code> were each modified by both Paul and 
  Wing and are indicated with the red double-headed arrows.
  <p>
  <li>Right-click on the <b>brtest</b> folder and select <b>Merge</b>.
  CVS will attempt to work out if there are any changes that are in
  conflict between Paul's local version and the repository. In our
  example, it updates <code>f1.txt</code> as well as 
  <code>f3trivial.txt</code> as it was able to resolve the conflicts 
  there.  However, <code>f4trivial.txt </code>presents
  it with a challenge and Eclipse will alert you that it was not able 
  to automatically merge the changes.
  <p><center><img src="images/threat1.jpg"/></center><p>
  As ominous as this appears, it's merely a reminder that we have
  to resolve some merge conflicts because they were not auto-mergeable.
  We could have avoided the spectacle of this message if we had
  simply checked the <b>Merge non-conflicting changes</b> checkbox.
  <p>
  Now lets resolve the conflicts.
  <p>
  <li>Double-click <code>f4conflict.txt</code> in the <i>Synchronize</i> 
  view to open the <i>Compare</i> editor of the merge tool. The left side 
  of the <i>Text Compare</i> panel is the local copy of the main branch 
  contents. The right side is the <b>brtest</b> branch contents. Since 
  this is not a trivial merge, the color red is used to delineate the 
  scope of each merge conflict. Blue would be used to denote trivial merges.
  <p>
  <img src="images/conflict8.jpg" alt="Resolving conflicts with merge editor"/>
  <p>
  We can't resolve this conflict by simply using one side or the
  other. For this case, we edit the text in the left side (local file) to
  say "This line changed by Paul and Wing in iter1." Right-click in 
  this same text window and select <b>Save</b>.
  <p> 
  <li>Even after the save, the entry in the conflict editor remains
  red.  That's because from the Eclipse SCM perspective, there is
  still a conflict.  It's just a conflict with some extra changes.
  We have to explicitly inform the Eclipse SCM that we have indeed
  resolved the conflict and that from this point onward, the changes
  to the local copy should be interpreted relative to the contents
  of the left-side.
  <p><center>
  <img src="images/markmerged.jpg"/>
  </center><p>
  This is done by right-clicking the file in the <i>Synchronize</i> 
  view and selecting <b>Mark as Merged</b>.  Do this now and notice
  there are no more conflicts.
  <p>

 <div class="note">
 <table class="note-table"><tbody><tr><td><img alt="[Note]" src="images/tip.gif"></td>
      <td>In Eclipse 3.3, the <b>Mark as Merged</b> action is also
          available from the context menu of the compare editor.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </div>
  <p>
  We have now completed merging the changes.
  <p> 
  <li>At this point, the merged copy only exists in our workspace. We
  still need to commit it to the CVS repository. Select the <b>brtest</b>
  project in the <i>Navigator</i> view and select <b>Team &rarr;
  Synchronize with Repository</b>.  These changes should not present any
  conflicts. Right-click on the <b>brtest</b> folder in the <i>Synchronize</i>
  view and select <b>Commit</b>. A suitable comment would be
  "Merged p1test branch up to P1 into main."
  <p> 
  <li>Tag the result as <b>WM1</b>.  This corresponds to the <b>WM1</b>
  tag in the <a href="#scenario">Scenario Diagram</a>.
  <p>
  <li>Be sure to update Wing's workspace with the results of the merge.
</ol>

<h2>Check Point</h2>

This completes the branch-and-merge scenario for Iteration 1.
The next section continues with a merge-again example.  But
let's pause for a moment to review what we have done.
<p>
Several files were used to
demonstrate different types of conflicts that arise during merge
activity. In cases where two developers edited the same file, we saw
that CVS was able to automatically merge trivial changes. Where manual
intervention was required, we saw how to use the merge editor to
manually resolve these conflicts.
<p> 
After the merge task was complete, we tagged the results to create
a release. Others can then refer to this release using the name
"p12merge." A summary of our actions for a single file is obtained by
right-clicking on the file in the <i>Navigator</i> view and selecting 
<b>Team &rarr; Show History</b>. The history for 
<code>f4conflict.txt</code> is shown below.
<p>
<img src="images/f4history2.jpg" alt="f4conflict.txt revision history">
<p> 
We can see that the <i>Root_p1test</i> tag is assigned to revision
1.1, the initial version. We see that Paul made changes that were
committed to a branch while Wing made changes that were committed to
main. Finally, the merge resulted in revision 1.3, which was tagged for
posterity with the label <b>WM1</b>. 
<p>
For many cases, this may be the only merge scenario you need.
It is certainly sufficient for short-lived branches that
introduce a new feature, test it, and then merge it into the
main branch.  For longer running branches where multiple
merges are required, the following merge-again scenario is
useful.

<h2>Merge Again</h2>

This is where Paul and Wing each continue to work on their 
own branch and synchronize again at a later time.  These
steps are part of <i>Iteration 2</i> in the
<a href="#scenario">Scenario Diagram</a>.  The file
editing is very similar to <i>Iteration 1</i>.  More emphasis
will be placed on the merging.
<p>
The following steps begin in Paul's workspace, which should 
still be pointing to the <b>p1test</b> branch.  If this is
not the case, switch to the <b>p1test</b> branch through the
usual method of right-clicking the project and selecting
<b>Replace with &rarr; Another Branch or Version</b>.

<p><ol>
   <li>Open <tt>f1.txt</tt>.  Change
   line 5 to read "This line changed in iter2."
   <p>
   <li>Open <tt>f3trivial.txt</tt> and change line 5 to read
   "This line changed by Paul in iter2."
   <p>
   <li>Open <tt>f4conflict.txt</tt> and change line 5 to
   read "This line changed by Paul in iter2.".
   <p>
   <li>Save the changes.  This completes the work represented
   by <b>PD2</b> in the <a href="#scenario">Scenario Diagram</a>.
   Commit these changes using a comment such
   as "Second iteration changes made by Paul."
   <p>
   <li>Tag this state of the project with <b>P2</b> using
   <b>Team &rarr; Tag as Version</b>.  This corresponds to
   the <b>P2</b> tag in the <a href="#scenario">Scenario Diagram</a>.
   <p>
   Wing will continue her work in her own workspace.  It should
   already be pointing to the main branch.  This work is 
   denoted by <b>WD2</b> on the scenario diagram.
   <p>
   <li>In Wing's workspace, open <tt>f2.txt</tt> and edit line
   5 to read "This line changed by Wing in iter2.".
   <p>
   <li>Open <tt>f3trivial.txt</tt> and change line 11 to read
   "This line changed by Wing in iter2."
   <p>
   <li>Open <tt>f4conflict.txt</tt> and change line 5 to read
   "This line changed by Wing in iter2."
   <p>
   <li>Save the changes.  This completes the work represented
   by <b>WD2</b> in the <a href="#scenario">Scenario Diagram</a>.
   Commit these changes using a comment such as "Second iteration
   changes made by Wing."
   <p>
   <li>Tag this state of the project with <b>W2</b>, referring
   a <a href="#howtotag">previous tag step</a> if needed.
   <p>
   Paul and Wing have both finished their <i>Iteration 2</i> 
   work.  This time Wing will perform the merge herself from
   within her own workspace.
   <p>
   <li>As Wing, in her workspace, click the <b>brtest</b>
   project and select <b>Team &rarr; Merge</b>.
   <p>
   <li>Click <b>Browse</b> next to the <b>end tag</b> field.
   Under <b>Branches</b>, select <b>p1test</b>.  If the branch
   is not visible yet, select <b>Refresh Tags</b>.  (Or you
   can simply use Content Assist.)  Click <b>OK</b>.
   <p>
   Notice that the <b>start tag</b> is populated already.
   But this is not the value we want.  Upon review of the
   <a href="#scenario">Scenario Diagram</a> we see that all
   we want to merge into main are the changes in the blue
   box labeled <b>PD2</b>.  But if we specify <b>Root_p1test</b>
   in the <b>start tag</b> field, we would also be merging
   in changes from the blue box labeled <b>PD1</b>.  The
   <b>PD1</b> changes were already merged during Iteration 1.
   Using this default start tag would cause the same changes
   to be applied twice.  This should be avoided even though
   it still works in many cases.
   <p>
   To apply only the changes since the last merge, we want
   to specify the <b>P1</b> tag.  This encapsulates 
   precisely the <b>PD2</b> development work.
   <p>
   <li>Click <b>Browse</b> next to the <b>start tag</b> field
   and select <b>P1</b> from the list of tags.  Click <b>OK</b>.
   <p>
   <li>Be sure to check <b>Merge non-conflicting changes</b> so
   that the auto-mergeable differences are applied automatically.
   <p>
   <img src="images/mergeDialog11.jpg"/>
   <p>
   Click <b>Finish</b>.
   <p>
   You should see the usual <b>Merge Failure</b> dialog indicating
   that a non-auto-mergeable conflict was encountered.  Click
   <b>OK</b> so we can get to work on resolving the conflict.
   <p>
   <li>The <i>Synchronize</i> view shows that, like before, 
   <code>f4conflict.txt</code> is the only file with a conflict.
   Double-click it to view the conflict in the Text Compare
   editor.  Shown below is the most important screen-shot of
   the merge-again scenario.
   <p>
   <img src="images/conflict4.jpg"/>
   <p>
   Notice there are two differences, but only one conflict.  The
   first difference is not marked in red.    That's because this
   line 3 <b>was not changed since the P1 tag</b>.  If we had
   allowed the start tag of the merge dialog to remain at
   <b>Root_p1test</b>, this would have been interpreted as a change and
   hence a conflict.  If we had not had the conflict in the second
   change of line 5, this would have auto-merged successfully.
   <p>
   Another point to note is that the reason there is even any
   difference at all in line 3 is that we are not rebasing in
   this scenario.  This is why line 3 of the branch is not in
   sync with line3 of main, even though it line 3 hasn't been
   changed since Iteration 1.  Rebasing is addressed in 
   <a href="article2.html">Part 2</a> of this article.
   <p>
   The following steps simply repeat the conflict resolution
   of Iteration 1.  This is represented by yellow diamond labeled
   <b>M2</b> in the scenario diagram. They are recounted here briefly.
   <p>
   <li>Edit line 5 of the local file to say, "This line changed
   by Paul and Wing in iter2."
   <p>
   <li>Right-click in the local file area and select <b>Save</b>.
   <p>
   <li>Right-click the <code>f4conflict.txt</code> entry in the
   <i>Synchronize</i> view and select <b>Mark as Merged</b>.
   <p>
   <li>Commit the merge with comment "Merged p1test branch from
   P1 to P2."
   <p>
   <li>Tag the result <b>WM2</b> as indicated in the
   <a href="#scenario">Scenario Diagram</a>.

</ol>

<h2>Summary</h2>
In this tutorial we illustrated the implementation steps for a
simple branch and merge scenario.  We then extended it with
a merge-again scenario.  We saw how tagging milestones and
merge results assist with future merges.  We also saw a subtle
effect of using these milestone tags for a base point rather
than simply falling back on the original branch point.
<p>
One consequence of the merge tactic chosen for this article
is that the <b>p1test</b> branch was never refreshed with
changes on the main branch.  This may be fine in some
circumstances.  To keep the <b>p1test</b> branch synchronized
with changes in the main, a rebase technique must be employed.
This is the tactic discussed in 
<a href="article2.html">Part 2</a> of this article.

<h2>An Alternative - Ongoing Merges</h2>
The Eclipse <i>CVS Merge Synchronization</i> view provides support
for <i>Ongoing Merges</i>.  This works by pinning the Merge
Synchronization view so that it continues to be present (behind
the scenes) and remembers what has already been merged.  So
in the merge-again scenario, if we had had the Merge Synchronization
view pinned since the first merge, then we could have left the
start tag with the default <b>Root_p1test</b>.  The CVS Merge
Synchronization view would have remembered the earlier merge
between <b>Root_p1test</b> and <b>P1</b> and not tried to re-apply
those changes.
<p>
The <i>Ongoing Merge</i> support works well, but has its
limitations.  In the scenario for this article, Paul did the
first merge while Wing did the second.  Unless the same
workspace is involved throughout the merge scenario, Ongoing 
Merge support is not feasible.  But in practice, one generally
does use the same workspace for merges, and so Ongoing Merge
support is a great help.  It provides these additional features.
<p><ol>
<li>Multiple Merge Synchronization views can be pinned.  This
   enables one to coordinate deliveries from multiple branches.<p>
<li>Merge Synchronization may be scheduled.  You can obtain the
   following configuration panel by clicking the Merge Synchronization
   menu button (the down arrow) and selecting <b>Schedule ...</b>.
   <p><img src="images/configMergeSync.jpg"/><p>
   So you become aware of work committed to other branches on
   a regular basis.
</ol><p>
The Ongoing Merge support should not entirely supplant tagging.
The merge points should still be tagged for milestone purposes
and in case the pinned Merge Synchronization view somehow becomes
unavailable.
The Ongoing Merge support is mentioned in the Eclipse Help under
<b>Workbench User's Guide &rarr; Reference &rarr; Team Support
with CVS &rarr; CVS Merge Synchronization</b>.
