      The Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) provides a framework for
      creating visual editors while being model agnostic. In most cases, people
      bring their own model which tend to be based on Plain Old Java Objects
      (POJOs). An alternative using POJOs is the Eclipse Modeling Framework
      (EMF), which provides many features for manipulating models that aren't
      found in POJOs. The purpose of this article is to build upon the shapes
      example provided by GEF using the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and to
      provide an introduction using EMF based models in GEF based editors.

      The types of problems web application developers face today require the

      provide flexible tool integration, a tool integration platform must allow
      tool developers to target different levels or integration based on the desired
      level of investment, time to market, and specific tool needs. Each integration
      level determines how a tool must behave, and what end users can expect as

One of the major tasks of adding a new language to an Eclipse-based IDE is debugging support. A debugger needs to start and stop the
program being debugged, suspend and resume, single-step, manage breakpoints and watch points,
and so on. This article explains the Eclipse Platform debug framework and steps through a
simple, yet illustrative, example of adding debug support for a new language.</font></td>

      Using OpenGL with SWT</a></b>

      <br>
	OpenGL is a vendor-neutral, multi-platform standard for creating
	high-performance 2D and 3D graphics. Hardware and software implementations
	exist on  various operating systems, including Windows, Linux and
	MacOS. OpenGL may be used to render simple 2D charts or complex 3D games. This
	article describes an experimental Eclipse plug-in that facilitates the use
	of OpenGL for drawing onto SWT widgets. A short history and overview of
	OpenGL is presented, followed by an example application.

      SWT uses operating system resources to deliver its native graphics and widget
      functionality. Allocating and freeing operating system resources is traditionally
      an area of programming that is error prone. Languages that include garbage

      burden of managing memory, but not from the allocation and freeing of operating

      When writing applications, you typically use the standard widgets provided
      by SWT. On occasion, you will need to extend the set of base widgets by
      creating your own custom widgets. For example, you might want to add a new

      of an existing widget. This article explains the different SWT extension

      The package <code>org.eclipse.swt.graphics</code> contains classes that

      The class <code>org.eclipse.swt.graphics.GC </code>encapsulates all of the

      and fill shapes. This article shows how to use a GC to draw onto an Image,

      SWT's Image class can be used to display images in a GUI. The most common
      source of images is to load from a standard file format such as GIF, JPEG,
      PNG, or BMP. Some controls, including Buttons and TreeItems, are able to
      display an Image directly through the setImage(Image) method, but any control's
      paint event allows images to be drawn through the callback's graphic context.
      SWT's ImageData class represents the raw data making up an SWT Image and
      determines the color for each pixel coordinate. This article shows the correct
      uses of ImageData and Image, shows how to load images from files, and how
      to achieve graphic effects such as transparency, alpha blending, animation,
      scaling, and custom cursors.</font></td>

      Understanding Decorators in Eclipse</a> </b>Balaji Krish-Sampath (IBM) January
      16, 2003</font> <br>
      Decorators, as the name suggests, are used for adorning/annotating resources
      with useful information. Decorators can be used by plug-ins to convey more
      information about a resource and other objects displayed in different workbench
      views.&nbsp; This article, with the help of a simple plug-in example, will
      illustrate the steps involved in decorating resources, along with some best
      practice approaches for decorating resources. Finally, we will discuss performance
      issues that may arise when enabling decorators, and briefly go over the
      new Lightweight decorators found in Eclipse 2.1.</td>

      A common problem in the implementation of applications is the implementation of
      project-specific properties that override workbench-wide preferences on project or file level. The
      naive approach is to implement these pages from scratch. However, writing the
      same code twice is a boring task and leads to increased maintenance efforts. In
      this article we show how existing preferences pages (with or without field
      editors) can be easily converted into pages that can act as both preference and
      property pages. We demonstrate this by implementing the abstract class <code>FieldEditorOverlayPage</code>
      providing the necessary functionality.</font></td>

      Using GEF with EMF</a></b>

      <br>
      The Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) provides a framework for
      creating visual editors while being model agnostic. In most cases, people
      bring their own model which tend to be based on Plain Old Java Objects
      (POJOs). An alternative using POJOs is the Eclipse Modeling Framework
      (EMF), which provides many features for manipulating models that aren't
      found in POJOs. The purpose of this article is to build upon the shapes
      example provided by GEF using the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and to
      provide an introduction using EMF based models in GEF based editors.

      Generating source code can save you time in your projects and can reduce
      the amount of tedious redundant programming. Generating source code can
      be powerful, but the program that writes the code can quickly become very
      complex and hard to understand. One way to reduce complexity and increase
      readability is to use templates. The Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) project
      contains two very powerful tools for generating source code: JET (Java Emitter
      Templates) and JMerge (Java Merge). With JET you can use a JSP-like syntax
      (actually a subset of the JSP syntax) that makes it easy to write templates
      that express the code you want to generate. JET is a generic template engine
      that can be used to generate SQL, XML, Java source code and other output
      from templates. </font>In this article you will learn how to create JET
      templates, how to use the JET Nature and JET Builder to automatically translate
      templates into Java classes, and how to use these classes to generate source
      code. This article also provides a short reference to the JET syntax.</td>

      In Part 2 of this JET (Java Emitter Templates) tutorial, we will take a
      look at the JET engine API. You will learn how to write plug-ins that use
      the classes in the JET package to generate Java source code. As a real-world
      example, we will create a plug-in that takes user input and generates a
      Typesafe Enumeration class. The generated source code is based on a JET
      template that can be distributed with the plug-in, allowing users of the
      plug-in to customize the generated code by editing the template. This article
      also provides a short reference to the JET API.</font></td>
