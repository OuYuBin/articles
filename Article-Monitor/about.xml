		Eclipse is most commonly used as a platform for tools that allow
		the user to construct or assemble an end product out of
		development resources. It is less usual to use Eclipse as an
		administrative tool for monitoring existing runtime systems or
		applications. This article will describe some of the issues that
		arise in this case and illustrate possible solutions. It will
		show you can build an Eclipse perspective dedicated to the
		monitoring task. Running processes are shown in a dedicated view
		which always reflects their current state. You can start/stop
		the process, manage connections, invoke operations that the
		server exposes, examine server output and view events generated
		by the running applications.
