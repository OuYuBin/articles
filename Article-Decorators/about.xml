		Decorators, as the name suggests, are used for
		adorning/annotating resources with useful information.
		Decorators can be used by plug-ins to convey more information
		about a resource and other objects displayed in different
		workbench views. This article, with the help of a simple plug-in
		example, will illustrate the steps involved in decorating
		resources, along with some best practice approaches for
		decorating resources. Finally, we will discuss performance
		issues that may arise when enabling decorators, and briefly go
		over the new lightweight decorators found in Eclipse 2.1.
