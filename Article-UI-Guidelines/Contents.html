<h2>
<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
In this document the Eclipse user interface guidelines are defined.
<p>Eclipse is a universal tool platform - an open, extensible IDE for anything,
but nothing in particular. The real value comes from tool plug-ins that
"teach" Eclipse how to work with things - Java&trade; files, Web content, graphics,
video - almost anything you can imagine. Eclipse allows you to independently
develop tools that integrate with other people's tools so seamlessly, you
won't know where one tool ends and another starts. The very notion of a
tool, as we know it, disappears completely.
<p>The platform is very flexible and extensible, but this flexibility has
a serious drawback.&nbsp; In particular, there is no way within the program
to ensure user interface consistency between the registered components
within the platform.&nbsp; This document attempts to reconcile this problem,
by defining standard user interface guidelines for the creation of new
components.&nbsp; If these guidelines are adopted within your own tools,
it will lead to greater consistency with the platform and other tools,
and an easier learning curve for your customers.
<p>These guidelines are intended for use by designers and implementors
of an Eclipse user interface extension.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="The Workbench"></a>The Workbench</h3>
To start out, let's take a look at the Eclipse workbench user interface, and the
various components within it.
<p>The workbench is a collection of windows.&nbsp; Each window contains
a menu bar, a toolbar, a shortcut bar and one or more perspectives.


<p><img src="images/workbench_decomposed.gif" hspace="40" height=713 width=794>

<p>
A perspective
is a visual container for a set of views and content editors.&nbsp; The views
exist wholly within the perspective and are not shared, but any opened content
editors are shared across perspectives.&nbsp; If two or more perspectives have the same view opened, they share the same instance of the view although its layout may differ in the perspectives.  For perspectives in different Workbench windows, neither editors nor views are shared. A perspective
is like a page within
a book.&nbsp; It exists within a window along with any number of other
perspectives and, like a page within a book, only one perspective is visible
at any time.

<p>The Workbench's main menu bar usually contains the File, Edit, Navigate, Project, Window, Help top-level menus. Other top-level menus that are in between
the Edit and Project menu are typically context specific, based on the
current active perspective, front most editor (whether active or not), and active view..

<p>In the File menu you will find a New submenu, which contains menu items
for Project, Folder, and File creation.&nbsp; The File menu also contains
menu items for Import and Export, which are used to import files into the
Workbench, and export them out again.&nbsp; In the Edit menu, you will
find familiar commands like Cut, Copy, Paste, and Delete.&nbsp; These commands
are known as global commands, and target the active part.
In other words, if the Delete command is invoked with
the Navigator active, the actual implementation is performed by the Navigator.
&nbsp; In the Project menu, you will find project related commands such as Open project,
Close project and Rebuild project are available.&nbsp; In the Run menu,
you will find commands related to running and debugging application code,
and launching external tools such Ant scripts.&nbsp; 
In the Window menu, you will find the Open Perspective submenu to open different
perspectives to suit to needs of your development tasks.&nbsp; You will find perspective
layout management menu items.&nbsp; You will also find the
Show View submenu to add views to the current Workbench window.&nbsp;
In addition, you will find the Preferences menu item, which is used to modify the functional
preferences of the Workbench.
<p>As a plug-in developer, you can contribute new views, editors, wizards,
menu, and tool items to the platform.&nbsp; These contributions are defined
using XML, and once registered, integrate seamlessly with the components
which already exist in the platform.
<h3>
<a NAME="Projects, Folder and Files"></a>Projects, Folders and Files</h3>
Eclipse can be used to create many different kinds of content - Java files, Web content, graphics,
video - almost anything you can imagine.&nbsp; These objects are stored
as regular files within the Eclipse workspace.&nbsp; The workspace consists
of one or more top level projects.&nbsp; Each project contains a collection
of folders and files.&nbsp; These objects are known as <i>resources</i>.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>

<h2>
<a NAME="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2>
For most developers, an introduction to the platform can be overwhelming,
and you may ask "where do I get started?".&nbsp; Here are a few basic guidelines
which will help you.

<p>This document is intended for UI designers and developers.&nbsp; With this audience
in mind, we can talk about the two main layers of any application: the
model layer and the user interface layer.&nbsp; In the model layer of Eclipse,
known as the Workspace, is a collection of resources (projects, folders
and files).&nbsp; The user interface, or the Workbench, defines the presentation
for those resources.

<p>As a UI developer, you will also have a model and a presentation.&nbsp;
If we assume that your goal is to make the model visible, through some
presentation, most developers will start out by adding a new view or editor
to the workbench.
<p><font color="#000000">In Eclipse, an editor is used to contain the primary content, such as a document or data object, which users interact with.&nbsp;In every case, this content is the primary focus of attention and a reflection
of the primary task.&nbsp; To illustrate this concept, let's look at some
common examples.</font>

<p><font color="#000000">To do Java programming, the primary task is to
create, edit, and debug Java code. The primary focus is the Java code,
so an editor is used to interact with that code.&nbsp; The navigator, outline,
and properties view exist to support the primary task, but rarely hold
your attention for an extended period of time while you are writing Java
code.</font>

<p><font color="#000000">To read email, the primary task is to create,
send, read, and reply to email. The primary focus is a particular email
message, so an editor is used to view or reply to an email message.&nbsp;
A view may be used to select an email message to read, and open an editor.</font>

<p><font color="#000000">To communicate using instant messaging, the primary
task is the conversation.&nbsp; The primary focus is a particular conversation,
so an editor is used to carry on that conversation.&nbsp; A view may be
used to list people with whom you can initiate a conversation.</font>

<p><font color="#000000">To browse the Web, the primary task is reading.
The primary focus is a particular Web page, so an editor is used to browse
the Web page.</font>

<p><font color="#000000">In each case, the primary task determines the primary 
focus of attention. As the primary focus of attention, it deserves a primary 
position in the UI</font> <font color="#000000">(as an editor), and can contribute 
commands to the workbench's main menu bar and toolbar.</font> 

<p><font color="#000000">A view may be used to save your favorite links, and reopen 
them.&nbsp; At any time, you may decide to edit the page you are looking at.&nbsp; 
This causes a new editor to open. Views are used to support the primary task.&nbsp; You 
use them to navigate a hierarchy of information, open an editor, or view properties 
for the active part.&nbsp; Each view may have its own local toolbar and local menu bar.</font> 

<p>Once you have added a view or editor, an interesting question arises.&nbsp;
Where did this model come from?&nbsp; In Eclipse, most data is created
using a creation wizard.&nbsp; You may want to add a creation wizard too.
And once an object exists, you may need a way to edit the properties for
that object using a properties page, or the properties dialog.

<p>All of these ideas will be discussed, in detail, in the following sections.
<p>

<h2>
<a NAME="General UI Guidelines"></a>General UI Guidelines</h2>


<br>This document defines UI guidelines that are unique and specific to
the Eclipse platform. It is a supplement to the other standard UI guidelines
such as Microsoft&reg; User Experience, Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines,
and Java Look and Feel Guidelines. You should continue to consult those
guidelines for basic UI design and implementation recommendations.
<p>It is expected that you already have a basic understanding of the Eclipse
UI architecture and APIs, and the basic UI design principles: user in control,
directness, consistency, forgiveness, feedback, aesthetics, and simplicity.
If you do not currently have the prerequisite knowledge, please read the
relevant documentation first.

design principles: user in control, directness, consistency, forgiveness,
feedback, aesthetics, and simplicity.</font></blockquote>

<h3>
<a NAME="The Spirit of Eclipse"></a>The Spirit of Eclipse</h3>
At its heart, Eclipse is a platform for tool plug-ins.&nbsp; These plug-ins
may be developed by a single team or by a partnership of teams, or the
user may assemble a set of plug-ins from diverse sources.&nbsp; In either
case, the usability of an individual tool, and Eclipse as a whole, will
be positively influenced by user interface consistency.
<p>If you're in doubt about the appropriate look and feel for a tool, look
to the platform first, then the Java development tooling and the Plug-in Development Environment (PDE) in Eclipse for
guidance. In many cases, the workflow you imagine may already exist in
Eclipse.&nbsp; If so, adopt the platform's workflow and user interface
conventions. This will lead to greater consistency with the platform and
other plug-ins, and an easier learning curve for your customers.

<p>In some scenarios, it may be tempting to ignore the workflow of Eclipse and 
implement a "custom" user interface.&nbsp; This interface will almost certainly 
stand out like a sore thumb in an integrated environment, where other tools 
adopt the platform conventions.&nbsp; You lose the benefit of past experience, 
and force your customers to learn new ideas. 

<p>Consult the <A href="#Best Practices" target="_right">Best Practices</A> section for examples and more information.

Guideline 1.2</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#006699">Follow the platform lead for user interface
conventions.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
</p>

If you decide to reuse the conventions of Eclipse, be careful not to misappropriate
Eclipse specific UI conventions.&nbsp; For instance, the active part in
a workbench window is indicated by a shaded title.&nbsp; The use of shaded
titles within an editor (see below) may be one way to indicate where the
focus is, within that part, but it will also blur the concept of part activation
in the window.

<h3>
<a NAME="Capitalization"></a>Capitalization</h3>
Consistent capitalization of text within a plug-in leads to a more polished
feel, and greater perception of quality.&nbsp; Within a dialog or window,
headline capitalization should be applied to all titles, menus, tooltip, tabs, and push buttons.&nbsp;For example, &quot;Run to Line&quot; can be used as a menu item label.
<P>Sentence style capitalization should
be applied to all check boxes, radio buttons, and group labels.
For example, &quot;Choose an option for the Java file&quot; can be used as a group label.</P>

<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b> <font color="#09448D">Guideline
1.5</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Use Headline style capitalization for
menus,  tooltip and all titles, including those used for windows, dialogs, tabs, column headings
and push buttons. Capitalize the first and last words, and all nouns, pronouns,
adjectives, verbs and adverbs.&nbsp; Do not include ending punctuation.</font></blockquote>

<img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">
Guideline 1.6</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Use Sentence style capitalization for
all control labels in a dialog or window, including those for check boxes,
radio buttons, group labels, and simple text fields.&nbsp; Capitalize the
first letter of the first word, and any proper names such as the word Java.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
</p>





<h3>
<a NAME="Language"></a>Language</h3>
Eclipse is available on a variety of different platforms, in a variety of
locales.&nbsp; In reflection of the different languages and numeric formats
in each, a localization strategy should be adopted for the text and images
within each plug-in.&nbsp; This involves the separation of all resources
from the source code of a plug-in itself, so that those resources can be
translated to a new locale.
<P>Consult the <A href="#Best Practices" target="_right">Best Practices</A> section for examples and more information.</P>
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">
Guideline 1.7</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Create localized version of the resources within your plug-in.</font></blockquote>

<hr>
<h3>
<a NAME="Error Handling"></a>Error Handling</h3>
If an error occurs in Eclipse, the appropriate response will be dependent
on the context of the error.
<p>Please refer to <A href="#Wizards">Wizards</A>
section  for guidelines on how to handle user input errors in a wizard.
<p>Please refer to <A href="#Editors">Editors</A>
section for guidelines on how to handle errors occur in an editor, .
<p>When an error occurs which requires either an explicit user input or
immediate attention from users, a modal dialog should be used to communicate
the error to the user.&nbsp; This forces the user to notice, and deal with
the problem.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
1.8</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">When an error occurs which requires either
an explicit user input or immediate attention from users, communicate the
occurrence with a modal dialog.</font></blockquote>

<hr>
<P>
If a programming error occurs in the product, an error dialog should be
used to communicate the occurrence to the user.&nbsp; The error should
also be logged using the workbench error logging facility.&nbsp; This gives
the user an opportunity to restart the platform, uninstall the corresponding feature,
and contact their system administrator.
<p>The plug-in should provide the following information in the detail area
of the error dialog:
<ul>
<li>
Provider name</li>

<li>
Plug-in name (user friendly name)</li>

<li>
Plug-in ID</li>

<li>
Version</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
1.9</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">If a programming error occurs in the
product, communicate the occurrence with a dialog, and log it.</font></blockquote>

<br>
<h2><a NAME="Introduction_VDG"></a>Visual Design</h2>

<p>
All visual user interface elements created for Eclipse follow a common style called the 
<strong><i>Eclipse visual style</i></strong> or <strong><i>Eclipse style</i></strong>. 
In these guidelines you will find basic design information, as well as specifications for 
implementing Eclipse style icons and wizard graphics in tools based on the Eclipse framework.

<p>
Following these guidelines will help ensure consistency of visual user interface elements and their implementation
across the Eclipse tools and plug-ins. Consistency of these elements includes visual semantic, style, and 
implementation considerations. These topics are covered in the following sections.

	

<!-- CONSISTENCY SECTION STARTS -->
<!-- Consistency -->

<p>
<h3><a NAME="Consistency_VDG">Consistency</a></h3>
<p>
In the development of the Eclipse style icons, a visual language was formed to describe a variety of concepts in the 
user interface. These concepts are now represented by a large selection of tiny visual signs that many have come to know 
through using Eclipse tools.</p>
<p>In order to ensure a consistent visual experience, understanding of concepts across the tools, and minimize 
confusion for the user, we encourage you to re-use Eclipse style graphical elements whenever possible.</p>

<br>
<h4><a NAME="ConsistencyConcept_VDG">Icon Reuse</a></h4>
<p>
A great many icons have already been created in the Eclipse visual style so there is a good chance many of the icons or 
graphical elements you may need already exist. A sample of the core concepts is shown in the following table. Each of these 
elements carries with it a specific meaning, so care should be taken when using them to ensure that consistent meaning 
is maintained.</p>

<!-- ICON SPECIFICATION SECTION STARTS -->
<!-- Icon Specifications / Icon Palettes -->
<br>
<h3><a NAME="IconSpecsPal_VDG">Icon Palettes</a></h3>
<p>Various palettes used in creating Eclipse style icons. 
There are 3 different palettes used to create the 3 different icon states, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>256 Color Palette</strong> for the active or selected &mdash; also referred to as "color"&mdash; state of all icon types
</li>
<li>
<strong>8 Color Grayscale Palette</strong> for the enabled state of perspective, view, toolbar, toolbar wizard, and local toolbar icons
</li>
<li>
<strong>2 Color Grayscale Palette</strong> for the disabled state of toolbar, toolbar wizard, and local toolbar icons
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h4>256 Color Palette</h4>
<p>
Eclipse style icons should be designed using a special 256 color palette that consists of 
20 standard colors and 236 custom colors, as shown below.
<p>
<IMG alt="newwin256.act" src="images/256palette.gif" hspace="40" width="194" height="193" border=0>
</p> 

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;
Although the color palette shown is based on the standard windows .aco 
color palette that comes with Adobe Photoshop, these two palettes are NOT the same and ONLY the 
shown color palette should be used when creating Eclipse style icons.

<h4>8 Color Grayscale Palette</h4>
<p>To create grayscale, enabled versions of your full color icons, you will need to use another
palette that consists of the 8 colors shown below:</p>

<!-- Icon Specifications / Icon Types -->
<br>
<br>
<h3><a NAME="IconSpecsTypes_VDG">Icon Types</a></h3>

<p>
The Eclipse style icons have been categorized into separate types so that each can be optimized for its specific 
location within the user interface. Below is a breakdown of these types and where they are located. 
</p>

<br>
<IMG height=345 alt="icon types" src="images/icon_types.gif" hspace="40" width =539 border=0>
<br>
<p>
<STRONG><FONT size=4>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>Product</STRONG> 
<br>The Product icon represents the branding of the product, and is always located on the far left
of the window title bar before the perspective, document, and product name.
</p>

<p>
<strong><font size=4>B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Perspective and Fastview</strong>
<br>Perspective and fastview icons are found down the left side of the workbench. These icons allow the user to quickly 
switch between different opened perspectives, or to invoke different views 
that have been created as fastviews.
<br></p>

<p>
<STRONG><FONT size=4>C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>Toolbar</STRONG>
<BR>Toolbar icons are found on the main toolbar across the top of the workbench. These icons invoke 
a command, either globally or within the editor.
<br></p>

<p>
<STRONG><FONT size=4>D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>Toolbar Wizard</STRONG>&nbsp; 
<BR>Toolbar wizard&nbsp;icons are found on the main toolbar across the top of the workbench. 
They are easily recognized by their wand and sparkle. Selecting one of these 
icons will launch a wizard.
<br></p>

<p><strong><font size=4>E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>View</strong>
<br>
View icons are found on the left side of the titlebar of 
each view within the workbench. These icons indicate each view’s function.
<br></p>

<p>
<STRONG><FONT size=4>F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>Local (View) Toolbar</STRONG> 
<br>Local toolbar icons are found to the right of the view icon on the titlebar of each view 
within the workbench. These icons invoke a command on objects in that view only. Local toolbar icons
are also found in all menus, including main, pull down, and context menus.
<br></p>

<p>
<STRONG><FONT size=4>G&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>Model Object</STRONG> 
<br> Model Object icons are found in tree views, list views, and on Editor Tabs within the the workbench 
(such as files, folders, projects and so on).
<br></p>

<p>
<STRONG><FONT size=4>H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>Object Overlay</STRONG> 
<br>Object overlay icons are also found in tree or list views. They are appended to the various 
corners of model object icons as signifiers of some sort of change.

<!-- Icon Specifications / Icon Size & Placement -->
<br>
<br>
<h3><a NAME="IconSpecsSize_VDG">Icon Size &amp; Placement</a></h3>
<p>
With few exceptions, Eclipse style icons are designed within an area of 16 x 16 pixels. Within that area, a 15 x 15 pixel 
space is reserved for the image itself, leaving both a vertical and horizontal line of empty pixels to allow for proper 
placement of the image within the interface. Note the location of the empty pixels in the samples below. The icons are 
cut with the specific placement shown to ensure alignment in the user interface.
</p>

<P>The diagrams below show the proper sizing of the separate types of icons, and their proper placement within the 
allotted screen space.</P>

<!-- Icon Specifications / Icon Overlays -->
<br>
<h3><a NAME="IconSpecsOvr_VDG">Icon Overlays</a></h3>
<p>
	As stated under Icon Size &amp; Placement, all overlays are consistently the same size: 7 x 8 pixels. 
	An additional white border keyline is included on Project Nature and Java Overlay types to visually separate them 
	from the underlying Model Object icon. The keyline location varies depending on the overlay's placement on the 
	underlying icon.
</p>

<strong>Project Nature Overlay</strong>
	<p>The project nature overlays are displayed in the Navigator and the Package views. 
	They are completely superimposed on the model object at the top right corner 
	of the 16 x 16 icon space.
	</p>
	<p>
	Only a few project nature overlay icons have been created to prevent crowding in the interface. 
	Project nature overlays quickly identify the various <strong>types</strong> of projects that can be contained in 
	the Navigator and mirroring views. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The white keyline border is applied around the image to enhance legibility.
	</p>

	alt="sample of a project nature overlay in the upper right corner of the model object icon"
	border="0">
	</p>
	
<br>
<strong>Auxiliary Overlay</strong>
	<p>The auxiliary overlays are displayed in all tree views. This type of overlay is completely superimposed 
	on the model object at the bottom left corner of the 16 x 16 icon space.</p>
	<p><img src="images/ovr_auxiliary.gif" hspace="40" width="180" height="180" alt="" border="0"></p>
	<p>
	The auxiliary overlay quickly identifies the <strong>status</strong> of an object. Examples of auxiliary overlays are
	<em>warning</em>, <em>error</em>, <em>failure</em>, and <em>success</em>.
	</p>
	
<br>
<strong>Java Overlay</strong>
<p>The Java overlays are displayed in the Outline, Hierarchy, and Package views. 
The Java overlays are appended to the model object icon, so they extend
the 16x16 icon space. They are placed to the right of a model object icon, overlapping the 16x16 model object space by 3 pixels. 
A maximum of 3 java overlays can be put on the model object.</p>
<p>The order in which an overlay appears depends on the order in which it has been assigned. In designing Java overlays, it is 
important to make sure the base object icon can support the addition of overlays without compromising readability. Note that there 
are two Java overlays that always display at the bottom right corner &mdash; 'C' position in the layout shown below &mdash; of the 
model object: 
<img src="images/synch_co.gif" width="7" height="8" alt="" border="0"> 
<strong>synchronized</strong> (method) and <img src="images/run_co.gif" width="7" height="8" alt="" border="0"> 
<strong>run</strong> (class).</p>
<p><img src="images/ovr_java.gif" hspace="40" width="276" height="218"

<img src="images/ovr_java_sample1.gif" hspace="40" width="276" height="218" 
alt="sample of java overlays to the right of the model object icon" border="0">
</p>

	<p>
	Java overlays identify <strong>attributes</strong> of an object. Examples of Java overlays are 
	<em>static</em>, <em>final</em>, <em>abstract</em>, and <em>synchronized</em>.
	</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the Hierarchy and Outline views, the Java overlays are appended to the right of the model object
as shown, but in the Package view they are stacked over the model object.</p>

<br>
<strong>Version Control Overlay</strong>
	<p>Version control overlays are displayed in the Navigator view and in the Structure View of the Merge Editor in CVS. 
	When they are displayed in the Navigator view, the overlay is completely superimposed on the model object at the right 
	of the 16 x 16 icon space.
	</p>
	
	<p><img src="images/ovr_versioncontrol.gif" hspace="40" width="180" height="180" 
	alt="size and location of the version control overlays in the Navigator view in the lower right corner of the model object icon" 
	border="0"></p>
	
	<p>When the version control overlays are displayed in the Structure View of the Merge Editor in CVS, they are 
	appended to the model object, so they extend the 16x16 space. They are placed to the right of a model object icon, 
	overlapping the 16x16 model object space by 3 pixels.
	In CVS there is a maximum of 2 overlays on the right of the object.</p>

	border="0">
	</p>
<br>

	<p>
	Version control overlays identify a <strong>transition-state</strong> of an object. Examples of CVS overlays are 
	<em>incoming</em>, <em>outgoing</em>, <em>in conflict</em>, <em>added</em>, <em>deleted</em>, and <em>changed</em>.

<!-- Implementation Ready -->
<h3><a NAME="ConsistencyImp_VDG">Implementation Conventions</a></h3>
<p>
Eclipse provides a set of directory names and structure for storing and accessing user interface graphics 
easily in any plug-in. This section describes the naming conventions and directory path used in Eclipse. If followed, 
the predefined directory names and path allow for the icon and wizard graphic files to be implemented directly into the 
plug-in structure without any need for modifications.
</p>
<p>
From icon request to delivery, the naming and structure is the same. If you use a different user interface 
directory name or more than one directory to store graphics than that specified at request time, notify your visual 
design contact of these changes so that they can maintain a parallel system. Further, keeping the number of directories 
in which you store your graphics to a minimum, will reduce unnecessary duplication of graphics and ease resource 
management issues considerably.
</p>

<br>

<h4>Directory Names and Structure</h4>
<p>
Once your icons have been conceptualized, designed, approved and cut, they are stored using the directory naming 
convention and structure described below.
</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>The name of the first level directory refers to the Eclipse platform: Icons used in an Eclipse plug-in are 
called <strong>org.eclipse.pluginname.ui_0.0.0</strong>. Where <strong>pluginname</strong> is substituted with the name
of the plug-in and <strong>_0.0.0</strong> is substituted with the Eclipse version number, for example, 
<strong>org.eclipse.debug.ui_2.1.0</strong>
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>Each plug-in that manages user interface elements for a tool set contains a second level directory
called <strong>icons</strong>.
<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>
Within the <strong>icons</strong> directory, there are separate folders with names that indicate the state, type and 
size of the icons, as follows:
<ol>
<li>
The first letter of the folder name indicates the icon state. The letter <strong>c</strong> for color,
<strong>d</strong> for disabled, and <strong>e</strong> for enabled.
<br>
</li>
<li>The next 3 to 6 letters signify the icon type: toolbar (tool), local toolbar (lcl), 
view or perspective (view), model object (obj), overlay (ovr), wizard banner (wizban).
<br>
</li>
<li>The last two digits of the folder name indicate the size of the icons within. Usually it 
will be <strong>16</strong> (to indicate the 16 pixel by 16 pixel size), but there might be others 
(for example, <strong>32</strong> would indicate the 32 x 32 size) depending on the plug-in requirements.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following image shows a complete directory structure for a plug-in.</p>
<p><img src="images/impready_folderstructure.gif" hspace="40" width="483" height="230" 
alt="Image showing the complete directory structure for user interface graphics a plug-in, as described in text above" 
border="0">
</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
For many plug-ins, inside the <strong>icons</strong> directory, there is a folder called "<strong>full</strong>" 
which then contains these icon type folders. This <strong>full</strong> folder is being phased out of the icon directory 
structure for new plug-ins. The structure shown above is the recommended icon directory structure.
</li>
<li>
Your plug-in may not require all types of icons shown in the sample. The sample illustrates the complete set of icon types 
that you may need in your plug-in. In addition, there are sometimes exceptions to this list of types in plug-ins that have 
a special type of icon that is not covered by this standard set. This is rare, however, and we encourage you to get to know 
the different types and their respective states, and use the structure as shown.
</li>
<li>When an icon has multiple states, the file name is the same across each of the active (color), enabled, and disabled 
state folders. Because of this organization, using the states provided is important, and will prevent you from having 
to rename the states of your icons if all were stored in the same folder.
</li>
</ol>

<br>
<h4>File Names</h4>
<p>Establishing file names before the icons are designed will help ensure appropriately descriptive names for the concepts 
they represent, and may prevent misuse of icons for purposes not intended and duplicate file names. If the names are well 
considered in advance, you will appreciate being able to quickly make the distinction between icon types and find concepts 
more readily, especially as the volume of your graphic resources increases.
</p>

<h4>Suggestions for File Name Suffixes</h4>
<p>File suffixes are useful for making the distinction between types of user interface elements. They can be used to denote
the location or function of an icon or wizard graphic. The following table shows how suffixes are being used for image file
names in Eclipse:

<h3>
<a NAME="Commands"></a>Commands</h3>
A command, which is invoked by a user to carry out some specific functions, may appear as an item in a menu, or an item in a toolbar.&nbsp;
In reflection of this, it has attributes for the menu or tool item label,
tooltip, and image.
<p>As a plug-in developer, you can contribute commands to the window menu
bar and toolbar, or to individual views and editors.&nbsp; Contribution
to the window is performed using an action set, a set of task oriented
commands which the user can show or hide.&nbsp; Contribution to a view or
editor is performed using individual command.
<p>Here is an illustration of the main areas of contribution.

<p><img src="images/actionExamples.gif" hspace="40" height="664" width="789">

<p>In this section we'll look at general command guidelines.&nbsp; For information
on window, view, or editor specific guidelines, see <a href="#Windows">Windows</a>,
<a href="#Views">Views</a>,
and <a href="#Editors">Editors</a>.
<h4>
Appearance</h4>
Each  command must have a label, tool tip, and image.&nbsp; If the command
appears in a toolbar, the command image will be displayed on all platforms.&nbsp;
If the command appears in a menu, the image will only be displayed on some
platforms, such as Windows&reg; 2000.&nbsp; The label and tool tip should use
Headline style capitalization, as defined in General UI Guidelines.
<p>Each command must provide one full color image.&nbsp; This image will
be displayed if the mouse is placed over the command.&nbsp; It will also
be used to generate the enabled, disabled, and pressed images which appear
in normal command use.&nbsp; Commands which are contributed in code also
have the option to define explicit images for enabled, disabled, and roll
over.&nbsp; This option can be used for greater control over image appearance.
<p>The following snapshot shows the valid use of Headline capitalization
in a toolbar.
<p><img src="images/tooltipCaps.gif" height=141 width=244>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
3.1</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Each command must have a label, tool tip,
and full color image.&nbsp; The label and tool tip must use Headline style
capitalization.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
The tool tips for a  command should describe the <i>behavior which occurs</i>
if the command is invoked, independent of the current state.&nbsp;For push buttons, the label should decribe the result of users pushing the button.
For toggle buttons, it should describe its effect when the item is toggled on, and the label should not change depending on the state of the button. In Eclipse version 2.1, it is recommended that the tool tip for a command uses the same text as that for the command label.
For instance, in the following snapshot
the behavior of the Show Type Hierarchy button is shown using one tool tips text.

<p><img src="images/goodTooltips.gif" hspace="40" height=169 width=213>

3.2</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">The command tooltip should describe the
result of the command, not the current state of the command. Use the text same as that for the command label.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
For consistency, any command which has a similar behavior to existing commands
in the workbench, should adopt the same terminology.
<p>When creating a resource, the term "New" should be used in a command
or wizard.&nbsp; For instance, "New File", "New Project" and "New Java
Class".&nbsp; The term "Delete" should be used when deleting an existing
resource.
<p>When creating an object inside a resource (e.g., a tag in an XML file;
a method or field in a Java class), the term "Add" should be used; the
user is adding something to an existing resource.

3.3</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Adopt the labeling terminology of the
workbench for New, Delete and Add commands.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>

<h4>
Enablement</h4>
A command should only be enabled if it can be completed successfully.&nbsp;
If this is not the case, the command should be disabled.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
3.4</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">A command should only be enabled if it
can be completed successfully.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
Command enablement should be quick to calculate.&nbsp; If it is too expensive
to calculate the enablement of a command, the command should be optimistically
enabled.&nbsp; If the command is invoked, it should calculate the real enablement,
and show a dialog to the user if it is not available.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Command enablement should be quick.&nbsp;
If command enablement cannot be quick, enable the command optimistically
and display an appropriate message if the command is invoked, but cannot
be completed.</font></blockquote>

<p>

<h3>
<a NAME="Dialogs"></a>Dialogs</h3>
A dialog is used for modal interaction with the user.&nbsp; It can be used
to solicit information, or provide feedback.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Initialization</h4>
When a dialog first opens, the initial focus should be given to the first
control where information is required from the user.&nbsp; This control
can be determined by the tab order of controls until a control is found
where information is required.&nbsp; If the dialog provides simple feedback,
or requires simple confirmation from the user, the initial focus may also
be assigned to the default button.

<h4>
Multiple Item Selection</h4>
Slush Bucket widgets (also known as the Twin Box design) should flow from
the left to the right with the source objects on the left and selected
files on the right.
<p>Slush Buckets should also have the following control buttons, in this
order, for moving objects from the source the selected buckets.

<p>

<h3>
<a NAME="Wizards"></a>Wizards</h3>
In Eclipse, a wizard is commonly used for the creation of new resources,
resource import, or resource export.&nbsp; It can also be used for the
execution of any task involving a sequential series of steps.&nbsp; A wizard
should be used if there are many steps in the task, and they must be completed
in a specific order.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
5.1</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Use a wizard for any task consisting
of many steps, which must be completed in a specific order.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>

<h4>
Appearance</h4>
At the top of each wizard is a header, containing a banner graphic and
a text area.&nbsp; The banner graphic contains an image representing the
wizard task, and should be created with a white to blue, gray scale palette
for consistency with other banners in Eclipse.&nbsp; These colors also
avoid distracting the user from the important fields of the wizard.&nbsp;
The text area is used to prompt the user for information which is absent,
and display error messages if information is invalid.&nbsp; The presence
of the header, with banner graphic and text area, creates a more polished
feel, and greater perception of quality to the wizard.
<p>At the bottom of each wizard, a Back, Next, Finish, and Cancel button
should appear.
<p><img src="images/wizardAppearance.gif" hspace="40" height=390 width=500>

a banner graphic and a text area for user feedback.&nbsp; It must also
contain Back, Next, Finish, and Cancel buttons in the footer.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>

<h4>
Initialization</h4>
When a wizard first opens, the focus should be placed in the first field
requiring information (see Guidelines 3.1).&nbsp; The header should be
used to prompt the user for the first piece of required information.
<p><img src="images/goodWizardInit.gif" height=122 width=570>
<p>It is not appropriate to display an error message.&nbsp; At this point,
the user hasn't done anything yet.
<p><img src="images/badWizardInit.gif" height=124 width=576>

5.3</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Start the wizard with a prompt, not an
error message.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
The initial state of the wizard should be derived from the context where
it is opened.&nbsp; For instance, in the New File wizard, the current workbench
selection is examined.&nbsp; If it points to a valid project or folder,
the wizard will pre-populate the parent field with the parent project or
folder name, and put cursor focus in the next field requiring user input.&nbsp;
If the user's selection does not point to a valid parent project or folder,
the wizard will not pre-populate the folder name. Instead, it will leave
the field blank and put the cursor focus in the field.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
the user's selection is on a file, a wizard may also go through these calculations
using the parent folder or project of the file.

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Seed the fields within the wizard using
the current workbench state.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>

<h4>
Validation of Data</h4>
Information validation within a wizard should be done in tab order.&nbsp;
If the first required field is empty, an informative prompt should be shown
in the text area, directing the user to fill in the field.&nbsp; If the
first required field is in error, an error message should be shown in the
text area.&nbsp; If the first required field is valid, check the next field,
and so on.&nbsp; The text area should not be used to display more than
one prompt or error at a time.
<p>If dialog information is absent or invalid, the Next or Finish buttons
should be disabled until the situation is resolved.&nbsp; When resolution
occurs, and all of the information has been provided, the Next or Finish
buttons may be enabled.
<p><img src="images/wizardErrorMsgs.gif" height=527 width=540>
<p>Error messages should only be displayed when user input is invalid.

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Only enable the Next / Finish buttons
if all required information in the dialog is present and valid.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
The error messages in a wizard should be intended for the end user, not
the developer.&nbsp; With this in mind, message IDs should never be presented
as part of the error text in the wizard's header area.

<hr>
<p>

<h4>
Browse Buttons</h4>
An edit field and "Browse..." button combination should be used whenever
an existing object is referenced within a wizard.&nbsp; The edit field
is used for direct input of the existing object, and the Browse button
is used to browse and select the object from a list of all possible choices.
<p>For instance, in the New Java Class wizard, a "Browse..." button is
placed beside the "Super Class" edit field.&nbsp; If the browse button
is pressed, a Browse Dialog will appear, and the user can select a super
class.&nbsp; This pattern should be used whenever a link will be established
between a new object and an old one.&nbsp; The "Browse..." button should
be located to the right of the edit field.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
5.8</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Use a Browse Button whenever an existing
object is referenced in a wizard.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
In the Browse Dialog, invalid choices should not appear.&nbsp; When the
dialog is closed, and focus returns to the parent control, refresh the
enablement state of controls within the dialog.&nbsp; In particular, refresh
the enablement of Next, Finish, and OK buttons.
<p>An example of valid and invalid filtering is shown in the following
snapshot.
<p><img src="images/folderSelection.gif" height=1220 width=611>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Wizard Completion</h4>
The New Resource and Import Wizards commonly create new files, folders,
and projects within the workbench.&nbsp; If a single file is created, the
wizard should open the file in an editor in the active page.&nbsp; If more
than one file is created, open the most important, or central file.&nbsp;
This makes it easier to modify and save the file.
<p>Have a readme.html file for every example project, and open that
readme.html automatically upon project creation.&nbsp; This will give users
an immediate overview of the example: what it does, prerequisites, limitations,
steps to take, and so on.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
5.9</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">If a new file is created, open the file
in an editor.&nbsp; If a group of files are created, open the most important,
or central file in an editor. Open the readme.html file upon creation of
an example project.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
If a new project is created, the wizard should change the active perspective
within the workbench to one which is appropriate for the new project type.
In Eclipse v2.1, users are prompted to confirm the switch to the preferred perspective when creating a new project.  
To avoid loss of context, plug-ins should use this, and not automatically switch without prompting.  
If users want to switch automatically in the future, they can choose &quot;Do not show this message again&quot; in 
the confirmation dialog.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
5.10</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">If a new project is created, prompt users and change the
active perspective to suit the project type.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
In either case, where a file, folder, or project is created, the wizard
should select and reveal the new object in the appropriate view.&nbsp;
This provides concrete evidence to the user that, yes, the new object was
created and now exists.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
5.11</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">If a new object is created, select and
reveal the new object in the appropriate view.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
In many situations, the creation of a resource may involve the creation
of a project or folder to contain the resource.&nbsp; If the containing
project or folder can be created from within the wizard (with a very reasonable
set of defaults), the wizard should allow it. If the creation of such resources
requires detailed user interaction in order for parent project or folder
to be set up correctly, the wizard should not attempt to do this. Instead,
the wizard error text should instruct the user that "The specified project
does not exist".
<p>The EAR Import wizard in IBM's WebSphere Studio is an example where allowing the user to specify
the name of the parent project in place makes for a much more usable interaction.
In this case, based on the user provided name, the wizard goes off and
creates not only the EAR project itself, but also any web projects, etc.,
that may be needed as well.

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Create folder objects in a wizard if
reasonable defaults can be defined.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>

<h4>
Terminology</h4>
Within a creation wizard, if the item being created must be a Project (not
a folder below a project), the term "Project" should be used.&nbsp; If it can be a folder below the project, the term
"Folder" should be used.&nbsp; In addition,  use the &quot;name&quot; suffix (uncapitalized) and no other prefix  for the  input field label. For example, use &quot;Project name&quot; or &quot;Folder name&quot; but not &quot;Project Name&quot; or &quot;Server Project name&quot;.

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Use the term "Project name" for the input field label when the
item must be a Project; otherwise, use the term "Folder name". Do not qualify
the term.</font></blockquote>

<h3>
<a NAME="Editors"></a>Editors</h3>
An editor is a visual component within a workbench page. It is
<FONT color="#000000">used to interact with the primary content, which
may be a document or data object.&nbsp; In every case, this content is
the primary focus of attention and a reflection of the primary task.</FONT>

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Use an editor to edit or browse a file,
document, or other primary content.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
Modifications made in an editor follow an open-save-close lifecycle model.&nbsp;
When an editor first opens, the editor contents should be unmodified (clean).&nbsp;
If the contents are modified, the editor should communicate this change
to the platform.&nbsp; In response, an asterisk will appear in the editor
tab.&nbsp; The modifications should be buffered within the edit model,
until such a time as the user explicitly saves them.&nbsp; At that point,
the modifications should be committed to the model storage.

<p>
An editor is document or input-centric.&nbsp; Each editor has an input,
and only one editor can exist for each editor input within a page.&nbsp;
This policy has been designed to simplify part management.

If the editor contains more than one page, a tab control should be used
for page activation.&nbsp; The use of this control is demonstrated by the
plugin file and html editors.
<p>Tab labels should be kept to one word, and two words at most.

<h4>
Menus</h4>
An editor may contribute items directly to the window menu bar.&nbsp; All
of the commands available in the editor should be displayed in the window
menu bar, for accessibility and clarity.
Exceptions are for the obvious commands, e.g. basic navigations such as  next / previous character, line, word.

<h4>
Toolbars</h4>
An editor may contribute commands directly to the window toolbar.&nbsp;
The toolbar is used to expose the
<I>most commonly used</I>
commands in an editor.&nbsp;
Any command which appears in the toolbar must also appear in the menu, but
there is no need to duplicate every command in the menu within the toolbar.

<hr>
<p>
The use of a local toolbar within an editor is contrary to the design of
the workbench.&nbsp; Within the workbench, the toolbar for an editor is
shared with editors of the same type.&nbsp; This reduces the flash which
occurs when you switch between editors, reduces the number of images and
commands in the product, and creates a better feel of integration.
<h4>
Context Menus</h4>
A context menu should be used for context sensitive interaction with the
objects in an editor.&nbsp; If an object is selected in an editor, and
the context menu is opened, the context menu should only contain commands
which are appropriate for the selection.&nbsp; Commands which affect the
presentation of the view should not appear in the context menu.
<p>In a text editor, you may assume that there is only one type of selection:
text.&nbsp; In this case, the contents of the context menu will remain
consistent for any selection in the editor.

a category of commands.&nbsp; The categories within the context menu should
be kept distinct from one another through the use of separators.

<p>
One of the primary goals for the platform UI is extensibility.&nbsp; In
fact, it is this extensibility which gives you the freedom to add new views,
editors, perspectives, and actions to the platform.&nbsp; Of course, extensibility
is a two way street.&nbsp; While you may wish to extend the platform, others
may wish to extend your view or editor.&nbsp; It is common for one plug-in
to add actions to the menu, toolbar, or context menu of an editor from
another plugin.
<p>In the platform, the menu and toolbar for an editor are automatically extended 
  by the platform.&nbsp; In contrast, context menu extension is supported in collaboration 
  between the editor and the platform.&nbsp; To achieve this collaboration, an 
  editor must register each context menu it contains with the platform.&nbsp; 
  It should also define a command filter for each object type in the editor.&nbsp; 
  A command filter makes it easier for one plug-in to add a command to objects 
  in an editor defined by another plug-in.&nbsp; The target is described using 
  object type and attributes.&nbsp;&nbsp; For more information on the implementation 
  of this concept, refer to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/viewArticle/ViewArticle2.html" target="_top">Creating 
  an Eclipse View.</a>

<h4>
Resource Deletion</h4>
When a resource is deleted from one of the navigators (e.g., Navigator
view, J2EE view, Data view, or DBA Explorer view in IBM's WebSphere Studio), the handling of any
editor that is currently open on that resource depends on whether the editor has any unsaved changes.
<p>If the editor does not contain any changes since the resource was last
saved then the editor should be immediately closed.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
6.16</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">If the input to an editor is deleted,
and the editor contains no changes, the editor should be closed.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
If the editor contains changes to the resource since the resource was last
saved (i.e., it is "dirty"), the editor should give the user a chance to
save their changes to another location, and then close.&nbsp; Here is a
sample of the dialog which should be displayed:
<p><img src="images/fileDeletedDialog.gif" hspace="40" height=124 width=436>

<hr>
<p>

<h4>
Unsaved Changes</h4>
If the editor contains changes to the resource since the resource was last
saved (i.e., it is "dirty"), an asterisk should be used to prefix the resource 
name presented in the editor tab:
<p><img src="images/dirtyEditor.gif" hspace="40" height=331 width=334>

<h4>
Read Only Files</h4>
With a name like "editor", it's not surprising that the issue of read-only
files may cause confusion.&nbsp; If it's read-only, how can you edit it?&nbsp;
In this case, you should fall back to first principles.
<blockquote>A view is typically used to navigate a hierarchy of information,
open an editor, or display properties for the active editor.&nbsp; An editor
is typically used to edit or browse a file, document or other input object.</blockquote>
This statement is appropriate whether a file is read-only or not.&nbsp;
In either case, the user should be able to select the file, open it, and
browse the contents within an editor. If the file is read-only, the File
> Save command should be disabled and the File > Save As should be enabled.
In the status bar area, "Read-only" should be shown instead of the default
"Writable" message.

<p>

<h4>
Integration with Other Views</h4>
In Eclipse, there is a special relationship between each editor and the
Outline view.&nbsp; When an editor is opened, the Outline view will connect
to the editor, and ask it for an outline model.&nbsp; If the editor answers
an outline model, that model will be displayed in the Outline view whenever
the editor is active.&nbsp; The outline is used to navigate through the content, or interact with the edit data at a higher level of abstraction.
<p>For instance, if you open a .java file in an editor, the structure of
the class is displayed in the Outline view.&nbsp; If you select a method
or field in the outline, the text declaration of that item will be selected
and revealed in the editor.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you select a method or field,
and open the context menu, you can interact with the item as a conceptual
unit, rather than just a bunch of text.
<p>In general, an editor should provide an outline model to the Outline
view if the data within the editor is too extensive to see on a single
screen, and will yield a structured outline.&nbsp; This structured outline
makes it very easy to navigate through objects like a java file or html
file.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
6.20</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">If the data within an editor is too extensive
to see on a single screen, and will yield a structured outline, the editor
should provide an outline model to the Outline view.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>

<p><br>When an editor has an interaction with the Outline view, notification
about location should be two-way. That is, the user should be able to select
something in the outline and have the editor position updated, and the
user should be able to select something in the editor pane and have the
outline view updated.
<p>A context&nbsp; menu should be available, as appropriate, in the outline
view which should support creation operations as appropriate.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
6.21</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Notification about location between an
editor and the Outline view should be two-way. A context menu should be available
in the Outline view as appropriate.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>

<p><br>If the edit model contains errors or warnings, they should be indicated
in the Outline view.&nbsp; An error or warning image should be added to
the item with the error or warning respectively.&nbsp; A container should have a red X if it there are errors on the container itself, a gray X if any of its descendents have errors (but not the container itself), and no X if neither the container nor any of its descendents have errors. For instance, in the
following line, the addFastView method has an error, so an error image
is added to the item and its parent.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img src="images/errorsInOutline.gif" hspace="40" height=284 width=223>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>For this to work, care must be taken to design icons with overlay in
mind, so that glyphs can be applied to the ancestor's icon.

In an editor, task objects are commonly used to mark a location within
a document.&nbsp; Once a task has been created, it appears in the Task
view.&nbsp; If the task is selected, you may reopen the editor at the location
defined in the Task.

<h4>
Line Numbers</h4>
Editors with source lines of text should have line numbers, and optionally
column numbers.&nbsp; Editors should also support Navigate -> Goto Line...
menu allowing users to quickly jump to a desired
line.&nbsp; The current line and column numbers should be shown in the status line (column number is optional).  It's optional for the editor to show line numbers for each line in the editor itself.

<h4>
Table Cell Editors</h4>
<P>If the editor contains tables with editable cells, a single-click over a cell should select the current item and put the cell
into edit mode. In edit mode, any dropdowns, buttons, or other controls
in the cell should be rendered upon the single-click.</P><p><img src="images/cellTableEditor.gif" hspace="40" height=383 width=284>

<hr>
<p>

<p><br>In addition, changes should be committed once a user clicks off
the cell or hits ENTER.
<p>The following are examples of good behaviour for a table cell editor:

<br><img src="images/cell1.gif" hspace="40" height=17 width=114>

to move up and down any number of choices and the drop-down stays visible
until user makes an explicit selection
<br><img src="images/cell2.gif" hspace="40" height=97 width=56>
<p>- first letter navigation is supported as a cursoring technique when
the drop-down is visible
<br>- supports the "Enter" key as a way of making an explicit selection
via the keyboard when the drop-down is visible
<br>- supports the "Esc" key as a way of canceling a selection via the
keyboard when the drop-down is visible
<br>- when put in edit mode, the drop-down control (the down-arrow image) appears with current selection active
&amp; highlighted

<h4>
Error Notification</h4>
If you are doing keystroke by keystroke validation in an editor, use red squiggles to underline the invalid content. When users move the mouse over the red squiggles, display the error text in a fly-over pop up box.

errors which are persisted.

<h4>
Interaction With External Editors</h4>
While a resource is opened within the workbench, if modifications are made
to it outside of the workbench, we recommend the following approach to
handle this situation. When the Save command is invoked in the editor, users
should be prompted to either override the changes made outside of the workbench,
or back out of the Save operation.
If desired, this user prompt can be invoked sooner such as when the editor regains the focus.

<h3>
<a NAME="Views"></a>Views</h3>
A view is a visual component within a workbench page.&nbsp; It is<font color="#000000">
used in a support role for the primary task.&nbsp; You use them to navigate
a hierarchy of information, open an editor, or view properties for the
active editor.</font>
<br>&nbsp;

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Use a view to navigate a hierarchy of
information, open an editor, or display the properties of an object.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
Modifications made in a view should be saved immediately.&nbsp; For instance,
if a file is modified in the Navigator, the changes are committed to the
workspace immediately.&nbsp; A change made in the Outline view is committed
to the edit model of the active editor immediately.&nbsp; For changes made
in the Properties view, if the property is a property of an open edit model,
it should be persisted to the edit model. If it is a property of a file,
persist to file.
<p>In the past, some views have tried to implement an editor style lifecycle,
with a Save command.&nbsp; This can cause confusion.&nbsp; The File menu
within a workbench window contains a Save command, but it only applies to
the active editor.&nbsp; It should not target the active view.&nbsp; This
leads to a situation where the File > Save command is in contradiction to
the Save command within the view.

<p>
Within a perspective, only one instance of a particular view can be opened.&nbsp;
This policy is designed to simplify part management for a user.&nbsp; The
user opens a view by invoking Perspective > Show View.&nbsp; If, for any
reason, they lose a view, or forget about its existence, they can simply
invoke Perspective > Show view again to make the view visible.

<hr>
<p>
In a multi-tasking world, humans often perform more than one task at a
time.&nbsp; In Eclipse, task separation can be achieved by creating a separate
perspective for each task.&nbsp; In reflection of this, a view must be able to be opened in more than one perspective.&nbsp; If only one
instance of a view may exist, the ability to multi-task is taken away.

<hr>
<p>
A view can be opened in two ways: by invoking Window > Show View >
X menu, where X is the name of the view, or by invoking another command
within the workbench.&nbsp; For instance, if you select a class in the
Packages view, and invoke Open Type Hierarchy, a Hierarchy view opens with
the class hierarchy for the selection.
<p>It should be possible to open any view from the Window > Show View
menu, either as an explicit item within the menu, or as an item within

<h4>
Appearance</h4>
A view consists of a title area, a toolbar, a pulldown menu, and an embedded
control.
<p>The view label in the title bar must be prefixed with label of the view
in Perspective > Show View menu.&nbsp; Given that it is impossible to change
the entry in the Show View menu, this means you cannot change the name
of a view.&nbsp; However, you can add additional text to the view label,
to clarify the state of the view.

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">The view label in the title bar must

<hr>
<p>
In most cases, a view will contain a single control or viewer.&nbsp; However,
it is possible to embed more than one viewer or control in the view.&nbsp;
If these controls are linked, such that selection in one control changes
the input of another, it may be better to separate the view into two. Users
will have greater freedom to open one of the results views, as their needs
arise. Special relationships can also be set up between these views to
support the user task. In addition, this makes it easier for users to create
a new perspective with a diverse set of views.

<hr>
<p>

<h4>
Initialization</h4>
When a view is opened, the input of the view should be derived from the
state of the perspective.&nbsp; The view may consult the window input
or selection, or the state of another view.&nbsp; For instance, if the
Outline view is opened, it will determine the active editor, query the
editor for an outline model, and display the outline model.

<hr>
<p>
If the view is used to navigate a hierarchy of resources (i.e., the Navigator
or Packages view), the input of the view may be derived from the window
input.&nbsp; The window input defines the scope of visible resources
within the perspective, and is defined by the user if they select a resource
in the Navigator and invoke Open in New Window.&nbsp; For instance, if the
Navigator view is opened, it will ask its perspective for the window
input.&nbsp; The result is used as the initial input for the view.

<h4>
Menus</h4>
<P>Use the view pulldown menu for presentation commands, not
selection-oriented commands.&nbsp;
These are commands which affect the presentation of the view, but not the
objects within the view.&nbsp;Do not put presentation commands in the context menu. For instance, the Sort and Filter commands
within the Navigator view affect the presentation of resources, but do
not affect the resources themselves.

<hr>
<p>

<h4>
Toolbars</h4>
The toolbar is used to expose the most commonly used commands in a view.&nbsp;
Any command which appears in the toolbar must also appear in the menu (either the context menu or the view menu), but
there is no need to duplicate every command in the menu within the toolbar.

<hr>
<p>

<h4>
Context Menus</h4>
A context menu should be used for context sensitive interaction with the
objects in a view.&nbsp; If an object is selected in a view, and the context
menu is opened, the context menu should only contain actions which are
appropriate for the selection.&nbsp; Actions which affect the presentation
of the view should not appear in the context menu.

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Fill the context menu with selection
oriented actions, not presentation actions.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
For consistency with other views in Eclipse, each view should adopt a common
order for commands within the context menu.&nbsp; This order is shown in
the following table.&nbsp; Within this table, each item represents a category
of commands.&nbsp; The categories within the context menu should be kept
distinct from one another through the use of separators.
<br>&nbsp;

<table class="indent" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" width="477" cols="1">

<td>Navigate + Show In</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Move, Rename and other refactoring commands</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Other Plugin Additions</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Properties</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The New category contains actions which create new objects.&nbsp; The
Open category contains actions which open the selection in an editor.&nbsp;
Navigate contains actions to refocus the view input, or reveal the view
selection in another view.&nbsp; And the other categories are self explanatory.

<hr>
<p>
For good spatial navigation of the menu, fill the context menu with a fixed set of
commands for each selection type.&nbsp; Once the contents have been defined,
the enablement state of each command should be determined using the selected
object state.&nbsp; In doing so, you establish a consistency which makes
the menu more predictable, and easier to navigate.

<hr>
<p>
An object in one view may be visible in many other views or editors.&nbsp;
For instance, a .java file is visible in the Navigator, the Hierarchy view,
and the Packages view.&nbsp; To the user, these objects are all the same,
regardless of location, so the context menu for the .java file should be
the same in each.
<p>Implementation tip:<BR>
To achieve a consistent context menu, plug-in developers which introduce
a new object type should contribute commands to the context menu using an
action group(ActionGroup class), a Java class which populates the context menu.&nbsp; If
this approach is used, the  action group can be reused by other views where the
same objects appear.

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">If an object appears in more than one
view, it should have the same context menu in each.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
One of the primary goals for the platform UI is extensibility.&nbsp; In
fact, it is this extensibility which gives you the freedom to add new views,
editors, perspectives, and actions to the platform.&nbsp; Of course, extensibility
is a two way street.&nbsp; While you may wish to extend the platform, others
may wish to extend your view or editor.&nbsp; It is common for one plug-in
to add actions to the menu, toolbar, or context menu of a view from another
plugin.
<p>In the platform, the menu and toolbar for a view are automatically extended 
  by the platform.&nbsp; In contrast, context menu extension is supported in collaboration 
  between the view and the platform.&nbsp; To achieve this collaboration, a view 
  must register each context menu it contains with the platform.&nbsp; It should 
  also define a command filter for each object type in the view.&nbsp; A command 
  filter makes it easier for one plug-in to add a command to objects in a view 
  defined by another plug-in.&nbsp; The command target is described using object 
  type and attributes.&nbsp;&nbsp; For more information on the implementation 
  of this concept, refer to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/viewArticle/ViewArticle2.html" target="_top">Creating

<h4>
Integration with the Window Menu Bar and Toolbar</h4>
The window menu bar contains a number of global commands, such as Cut, Copy,
and Paste within the Edit menu.&nbsp; These commands target the active part,
as indicated by a shaded title area.&nbsp; If these commands are supported
within a view, the view should hook these window commands, so that selection
in the window menu bar or toolbar produces the same result as selection
of the same command in the view.
<p>A complete list of the global commands and built-in menus as declared in IWorkbenchActionConstants.java
(see below).
<p><tt></tt>File menu: Revert, Move, Rename, Refresh, Print, Properties<BR>

<hr>
<p>
<font color="#000000">Although a view can't directly contribute to the main menubar or toolbar in Eclipse v2.1, it can still cause commands to appear there using &quot;action set / part associations&quot; (the actionSetPartAssociations extension point) which lets you associate action sets with particular parts (views or editors).  For example, the Java tooling in Eclipse  uses this for the Package Explorer.<BR>
<BR>
All commands for the view (or editor) should be made available on the main menubar, and only frequently used commands are on the context menu.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, the primary perspective(s) for such views (e.g. the Java and Java Browsing perspectives) should already have these action sets associated with the perspective, to improve UI stability.<BR>
<BR></font></P>
<h4>
Persistence</h4>
One of the primary goals for the platform UI is to provide efficient interaction
with the workspace.&nbsp; In the platform this is promoted by saving the
state of the workbench when a session ends (the workbench is shut down).&nbsp;
When a new session is started (the workbench is opened), this state is
restored, reducing the time required for the user to get back to work.
<p>If a view has a static input object, in the sense that its input is not derived 
  from selection in other parts, the state of the view should be persisted between 
  sessions. If a view has a dynamic or transient input object, there is no need 
  to persist its state between sessions. Within the workbench, the state of the 
  Navigator view, including the input and expansion state, is saved between sessions. 
  For more information on the implementation of persistence, see "<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/viewArticle/ViewArticle2.html" target="_top">Creating 
  an Eclipse View</a>". <br>

<h3>
<a NAME="Perspectives"></a>Perspectives</h3>
A perspective is a visual container for a set of views and editors (parts).&nbsp;
Different perspectives can have different sets of views open, but if they both have the same view open, it's shared between them (but only if they are in the same workbench window).  Editors are always all shared between perspectives in the same window.
<p>A new perspective is opened by invoking Window -> Open Perspective -> X, where
X identifies a particular perspective in Eclipse.&nbsp; The result is a
new perspective in the workbench window with <i>type</i> X.&nbsp; For instance,
if you invoke Window -> Open Perspective -> Resource, a new perspective is opened
with type <i>Resource</i>.&nbsp; Eclipse comes with a pre-defined number
of perspective types, such as Resource, Java, and Debug.&nbsp; The perspective
type determines the initial layout of views, and visibility of command sets
within the perspective.
<p>As a plug-in developer, you may contribute new perspective types to Eclipse.&nbsp; 
  To do this, you must define a perspective extension.&nbsp; Each extension has 
  a <i>perspective factory</i>, a Java class which defines the initial layout 
  of views, and visibility of command sets within the perspective.&nbsp; You can 
  also add your own actions or views to an existing perspective type.&nbsp; For 
  more information on the implementation of these concepts, see <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/using-perspectives/PerspectiveArticle.html" target="_top">Using 
  Perspectives in the Eclipse UI</a>. 
<p>A new perspective type should be created when there is a group of related
non-modal tasks which would benefit from a predefined configuration of commands and
views, and these tasks are long lived.&nbsp; A task oriented approach is
imperative.&nbsp; As a development environment, Eclipse was designed to
fulfill the needs of a large product development team, from product manager
to content developer to product tester.&nbsp; It is fully extensible and
may be configured with hundreds of command, wizard, view and editor extensions.&nbsp;
In other words, it may contain a lot of features you'll never use.&nbsp; To
avoid the visual overload and confusion which would occur if everything
was visible in the UI, a perspective can be used to limit the presentation to a task-oriented set of views and command sets.
<p>For instance, the task of Java code creation is long lived and complex,
so the creation of a Java perspective is warranted.&nbsp; In Eclipse, the
Java perspective contains an editor area, Packages Explorer view, Hierarchy view,
Tasks view, and Outline view.&nbsp; The Java and Debug command sets are
also visible.&nbsp; Together, these components are useful for a variety
of long lived, Java coding tasks.
<p>It is not appropriate to create a new perspective type for short lived
tasks.&nbsp; For instance, the task of resource check-in is short lived,
so it may be better performed using a view in the current perspective.
<br>&nbsp;

8.1</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Create a new perspective type for long
lived tasks, which involve the performance of smaller, non-modal tasks.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
If your plug-in contributes a small number of views, and these augment
an existing task, it is better to add those views to an existing perspective.&nbsp;
For instance, if you create a view which augments the task of Java code
creation, don't create a new perspective.&nbsp; Instead, add it to the
existing Java perspective.&nbsp; This strategy provides better integration
with the existing platform.

8.2</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">If you just want to expose a single view,
or two, extend an existing perspective type.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>

<h4>
View Layout</h4>
If the user opens a new perspective, the initial layout of views will be
defined by the perspective type (i.e., Resource, Java).&nbsp; This
layout is performed in the <i>perspective factory</i>, a Java class associated
with the perspective type.&nbsp; When the perspective is initialized, it
consists of an editor area with no additional views.&nbsp; The perspective
factory may add new views, using the editor area as the initial point of
reference.
<p>The size and position of each view is controlled by the perspective
factory.&nbsp;&nbsp; These attributes should be defined in a reasonable
manner, such that the user can resize or move a view if they desire it.
An important issue to consider is the overall flow between the views (and editors) in the perspective.  For example,  initially the navigation views may be placed to the left of the editor area, outline views may be placed either to the right of the editor area or below the navigation view, and other supporting views may be placed below and to the right of the editor area.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
8.3</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">The size and position of each view in

can resize or move a view if they desire it. When defining the initial layout, it is important to consider the overall flow between the views (and editors) in the perspective.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
A perspective should have at least two parts, including the visible views
and the editor area.&nbsp; If this is not the case, then the perspective
should be re-examined to determine if it is better suited as a view or
editor.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
8.4&nbsp;</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">If a perspective has just one part, it
may be better suited as a view or editor.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
In some scenarios, it may be undesirable to have an editor area within
a perspective.&nbsp; In this case, the perspective factory should hide
the editor area, using the existing java methods.&nbsp; It is not acceptable
to resize the editor area to a point where it is no longer visible.&nbsp;
If the user does open an editor in the perspective, for whatever reason,
they will be unable to see or resize it.
<p>When the editor area is programmatically hidden, if the user opens an
editor in the perspective, the editor area will become visible. The view
that occupied the editor area before will be shrunk. Therefore, it is
important to define a non-empty editor area even when the editor is programmatically
hidden.

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">If it is undesirable to have an editor
area in a perspective, hide it.&nbsp; Do not resize the editor area to
the point where it is no longer visible.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>

<h4>
Command Contribution</h4>
The perspective factory may add actions to the File > New, Window > Open Perspective
, and&nbsp; Window > Show View menus.&nbsp; It is also possible
to add one or more command sets to the window.&nbsp; In each case, you should
choose commands which are relevant to the task orientation of the perspective.
<p>The File > New menu should be populated with wizards for the creation
of objects commonly used in the task.&nbsp; For instance, in the Java perspective
the File > New menu contains menu items for the creation of packages, classes,
and interfaces.
<p>The Window > Show View menu should be populated with the initial
views in the perspective, as well as any extra views that may be important
for the task at hand.
The Navigate &gt; Show In menu should be used to allow users to navigate in their contents.<p><img src="images/showViewMenu.gif" hspace="40" height=325 width=486>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The application development lifecycle should be considered when populating
the the Window - Open Perspective menu.&nbsp; The development of most applications
follow a well defined lifecycle, from designing / modeling, to editing
/ creating, to debugging / testing, to assembling / deploying.&nbsp; Each
perspective will fall into one of these steps.&nbsp; The Open
Perspective menu should be used to link the current perspective to perspectives
that support tasks immediately downstream of the current one, as well as
tasks further upstream, to allow for iterative development.
<p>For instance, the Java perspective is used in a larger lifecycle, involving
Java and Debug tasks.&nbsp; The Window > Open Perspective menu is populated
with each of these perspectives.

<hr>
<p>

<h4>
Opening a Perspective in Code</h4>
A command should only open a new perspective if the user explicitly states
a desire to do so.&nbsp; If the user does not state a desire to do so,
it may cause loss of context.
<p>For instance, imagine a scenario where the user selects an object and
invokes a command.&nbsp; In the perspective where the command is invoked,
the user may have a set of views and editors open.&nbsp; These represent
the working state, or context, of the user.&nbsp; If a new perspective
is created, that context will be left behind, forcing the user to recreate
the context.&nbsp; This is time wasted.

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">A new perspective should be opened only
if the user explicitly states a desire to do so.&nbsp; In making this statement,
the user agrees to leave their old context, and create a new one.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
In some cases, a new perspective is opened as the side effect of another
command.&nbsp; For instance, if users start debugging their application code, they may be switched to the Debug perspective.&nbsp; If this
behavior is implemented, the user should have the option to turn this behavior
off.&nbsp; The option can be exposed in the command dialog, or within a
Preference page.

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">If a new perspective is opened as a side
effect of another command, the user should be able to turn this behavior
off.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
If a new perspective is opened, it may be opened within the current
window, or in a new window.&nbsp; The user controls this option using the
Workbench preferences.&nbsp; If code within a plug-in opens a new perspective,
the plug-in should honor the user preference.

<h3>
<a NAME="Windows"></a>Windows</h3>
In this section we look at the window menu bar, toolbar, and layout.&nbsp;
As a plug-in developer, you can contribute actions to the menu bar and
toolbar using an <i>action set</i>, a set of task oriented actions which
the user can show or hide.&nbsp; You can control the layout of views within
a window by defining a <i>perspective</i>.&nbsp; In this section we'll
look at action extension.&nbsp; For more information on perspectives, see
<a href="#Perspectives">Perspectives</a>.
<h4>
Actions</h4>
Each workbench window contains a menu bar and toolbar.&nbsp; These are
pre-populated by the platform, but a plug-in developer may add additional
items to each.&nbsp; This is done by defining an <i>action set</i>, a set
of task oriented actions which the user can show or hide.&nbsp; The actions
within an action set may be distributed throughout the window menu bar
and toolbar.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
9.1</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Use an Action Set to contribute actions
to the window menu bar and toolbar.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
The window menu bar contains a number of pulldown menus: File, Edit, Navigate,
Project, Window, and Help.&nbsp; Each of these has a different purpose,
which will be explained in the following paragraphs.&nbsp; For consistency
with the action sets contributed by other plug-ins, the commands within
an action set should conform to the existing distribution of actions in
the window.&nbsp; There is no need to group the actions in a separate pulldown
menu of the menu bar.
<p>The File menu contains file oriented actions, such as Save, Close, Print,
Import, Export and Exit.&nbsp; The contents of the File > New menu are
determined by the perspective type.&nbsp; However, the user may add or
remove items using the Window -> Customize Perspective... menu item.&nbsp; The contents
of the Import and Export dialogs are populated with every import and export
wizard, respectively.
<p>The Edit menu contains editor oriented actions, such as Undo, Redo,
Cut, Copy, and Paste.&nbsp; These actions target the active part (as indicated
by a shaded title bar) .&nbsp; It is very common for an editor to add items
to this menu.&nbsp; However, it is uncommon for an action set to add actions
to the Edit Menu; action sets tend to be global in nature, while the edit
menu targets a specific part, and interaction with the data in that part.
<p>The Navigate menu contains navigational actions such as Go to, Open Type,
Show In, to enable users to browse laterally or drill down in their code.
<p>The Project menu contains actions which apply to the contents of the
workspace, such as Rebuild All and Open Type.&nbsp; An action set may add
actions which search the entire workspace, generate project info and so on.
<p>The Window menu contains actions which apply to window management and
system preferences. It also contains the Open Perspective and Show View
submenu which contains actions affecting the state of the window contents.

9.2</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Follow the platform lead when distributing
actions within an Action Set.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
The toolbar contains the most commonly used actions of the menu bar.&nbsp;
In reflection of this, you should contribute actions to the menu bar first,
and then to the toolbar if they will be frequently used.

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Contribute actions to the window menu

<hr>
<p>
The contents of each action set should be defined using a task oriented
approach.&nbsp; For instance, the Java action set contains actions to create
a new package, class and interfaces.&nbsp; It also contains a command to
open an editor on a class, Goto Type. These form a cohesive set of related
actions, which can be turned on and off by the user, depending on the active
task.

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Define each action set with a specific
task in mind.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
The size of an action set is also important.&nbsp; If an action set is
too large, it will flood the menu or toolbar, and reduce the users ability
to customize the menu and toolbar.&nbsp; At the same time, if an action
set is too small, the user may find customization of the menu and toolbar
is too labor intensive.&nbsp; Break an action set up when it has more than
about 7 items.
<p>There is no magic number for the size of an action set, but it should
be carefully designed to contain the smallest possible semantic chunking
of actions. Avoid the temptation to provide only one action set for an
entire plug-in.

<hr>
<p>
An action set can be used to share a set of actions between two or more
views and editors.&nbsp; For instance, a Java Refactor action set may be
applicable to the selection within a Java Editor, an Outline view, and
a Hierarchy View.&nbsp; In this situation the actions can be shared by
defining an action set extension for the workbench.&nbsp; Once this action
set has been defined, it can be automatically included in a perspective
by the perspective developer, or added to a perspective by the user.
<p>An action set should not be used to promote command from a single view
to the window menu bar and toolbar.&nbsp; This simply clutters up the user
interface.

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Use an action set to share a set of actions

<hr>
<p>
The set of visible command in a window may be changed by invoking Window >
Customize Perspective.&nbsp; Within the resulting dialog, you can add or remove items
from the File > New menu, Window > Open Perspective menu, or Window > Show
View menu.&nbsp; It is also possible to add or remove action sets.&nbsp;
In general, the visible action sets should be controlled by the user, and
should never be changed programmatically.&nbsp; There are two reasons for
this.&nbsp; First, users like to control the environment, not be controlled.&nbsp;
And second, the user is in the best position to understand the active task,
and the appropriate action sets for its completion.

<p>

A common example of a command which may be added to an action set is Navigate
> Open Type.&nbsp; This command can be used to open an editor on a type
which is not visible in the current window, and is a form of lateral navigation.&nbsp;
In general, all Open actions which take the form should be added to the
Navigate menu, for consistency.

<h4>
Status Bar</h4>
If there is a need for a plug-in to show non-modal contextual information
in the status bar area, always use the global status bar.
For example, editors use the global status bar to show the current line and column number.<br>&nbsp;
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline

<h3>
<a NAME="Properties"></a>Properties</h3>
A Properties dialog or view is used to view / modify the properties of
an object which are not visible in the normal presentation of that object.
For instance, the Read Only attribute for a file is modified in the Properties
Dialog.&nbsp; The build path for a Java Project is modified in the Properties
Dialog.
<p>Within Eclipse, there are two ways to edit the properties of an object:
in the Properties dialog, and in the Properties view.&nbsp; Each of these
is applicable in different situations.
<p>The Properties view is commonly used to edit the properties for a set
of objects in an editor, where quick access to the properties is important,
and you switch from one object to another quickly.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
10.1</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Use the Properties view to edit the properties
of an object when quick access is important, and you will switch quickly
from object to object.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
The properties for an object should be quick to calculate.&nbsp; If it
is too expensive to calculate the properties for an object, the quick access
to properties offered by the Properties view becomes worthless.&nbsp; In
this situation, where quick access is not possible, a Properties Dialog
should be used.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
10.2</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Use a Properties Dialog to edit the properties
of an object which are expensive to calculate.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
In some cases, the properties for an object are dependent upon one another,
such that a change in one will affect another, or even enable / disable
the option to change another.&nbsp; In this situation, a Properties Dialog
may be a better way to represent the semantic link between these properties.
<br>&nbsp;

the properties of an object which contain complex relationships to one
another.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
When both the Properties view and the Properties Dialog are used to present
and edit properties of an object, the Properties Dialog should contain
the superset of items shown in the Properties view.

<h3>
<a NAME="Widgets"></a>Widgets</h3>
In this section, we will describe some of the recommended designs for Standard Windows Toolkit (SWT)
widgets.

<p>
<h4>Tree and Table</h4>
For Tree and Table widgets that have a checkbox associated with a cell item,
users can either select the item or change the checkbox state.
Changing the current selection should not automatically change the check state
of the selected item.
However, the current selection should be set to a given item 
when its check state is changed (e.g. users click on the checkbox associated
with the item).

<h2>
<a NAME="Standard Components"></a>Standard Components</h2>
In this section we'll look at the standard components which ship with Eclipse.&nbsp;
The Eclipse SDK contains a number of views, including the Navigator, Outline,
Properties, Tasks, and Bookmarks view.&nbsp; Eclipse also contains a default
text editor and a Resource perspective.
<p>As a plug-in developer, you should try to add new actions to the existing
parts.&nbsp; This leads to better integration with the platform, and the
existing knowledge of the user.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">If appropriate, add actions to standard
components of Eclipse using the plug-in registry.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>

<p><br>When extending the standard components such as the Navigator, Outline,
Properties, Tasks, and Bookmark views, make sure your specialized components
carry over the base component's characteristics (drag and drop support,
keyboard navigation, selection behaviour, etc.)
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
12.2</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">If you subclass or copy any of the standard
components, always carry over the standard components' characteristics.</font></blockquote>

<p><br>


<h3>
<a NAME="Navigator"></a>The Navigator View</h3>
The Navigator is used to navigate the workspace, create new resources,
modify resources, and open an editor on a resource.&nbsp; Plug-in developers
may contribute new actions to the menu, toolbar, and context menu.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Adding Actions</h4>
This is done by adding an extension to the plug-in registry.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
13.1</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Add actions to the Navigator View menu,
toolbar, and context menu using the plug-in registry.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
If object contributions are made to the context menu, try to qualify the
target object as much as possible, to avoid adding the command to the wrong
objects in the Navigator.&nbsp; For instance, a Java command may target
IFiles with a .java extension, or IProjects with a Java nature.&nbsp; It
will cause confusion if Java actions appear on non-java objects.
<p>Some actions are a reflection of tool use, rather than object type.&nbsp;
For instance, a repository plug-in may provide actions for file check in,
check out, etc.&nbsp; These actions should only appear on the resources
in the Navigator if the user has actively chosen to use the repository
tool.&nbsp; To control the visibility of these actions, the plug-in should
apply a project nature to the managed resources, and use the project nature
attribute in all context menu contributions.
<p>For more information on command filtering,&nbsp; refer to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/viewArticle/ViewArticle2.html" target="_top">Creating 
  an Eclipse View</a>.&nbsp; The standard attributes for resources are defined 
  in IResourceActionFilter.java (see below). 
<pre>public interface IResourceActionFilter extends IActionFilter {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static final String NAME = "name";&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static final String EXTENSION = "extension";

<pre>public interface IProjectActionFilter extends IResourceActionFilter {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static final String NATURE = "nature";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static final String OPEN = "open";

<hr>
<p>

<h4>
Integration with Other Views and Editors</h4>
In Eclipse, the use of a "Navigate -&gt; Show In" command is a common way to link the selection
in one view to the input of another.&nbsp; For instance, a "Show in Package Explorer"
command is visible in the context menu for a selected class in the  source editor.&nbsp;
When invoked, the class in the source editor is selected and revealed in
the Package Explorer view.&nbsp; This approach should be used as a general, non
intrusive pattern for view or editor linking.&nbsp; It is context sensitive,
and reflects the intentions of the user.
<p>A "Navigate -&gt; Show In Navigator" command should be included in any view where a
resource may appear.&nbsp; If invoked, the command should select and reveal
the resource in the navigator.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
13.3</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Use a "Navigate -&gt; Show In Navigator" command in each
view, to link resources back to the Navigator.</font></blockquote>"


<h3>
<a NAME="Tasks"></a>The Tasks View</h3>
The Tasks view is used to display the current tasks, errors and warnings
in the workspace.&nbsp; A plug-in developer may contribute new tasks, errors,
and warnings to the workspace, and rely upon the Tasks view to display
those objects.&nbsp; You can also contribute new actions to the menu, toolbar,
and context menu.&nbsp; This is done by adding an extension to the plug-in
registry.
<h4>
Adding Tasks</h4>
A new task, error or warning can be created using the Marker Manager services
from the Core Resources Management plugin.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Add markers (tasks, errors and warnings)
to the Tasks view using the Marker Manager services from the Core Resources
Management plugin.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
The Tasks view is a table, containing columns for the task image, completion
status, priority, description, resource, and line number.&nbsp; The description
text of each marker should be short and concise, so that it will fit in
the status line of Eclipse.

<hr>
<p>
If object contributions are made to the context menu, try to qualify the target 
object as much as possible, to avoid adding the command to the wrong objects in 
the Tasks view.&nbsp; At an implementation level, each object in the Tasks view 
is a <i>marker</i>, a general mechanism for associate notes with a resource.&nbsp; 
Use the attributes within IMarkerActionFilter.java to control the visibility of 
Task object actions (see below).&nbsp; For more information on command filtering,&nbsp; 
refer to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/viewArticle/ViewArticle2.html" target="_top">Creating

<h4>
Integration with Other Views and Editors</h4>
In an editor, task objects are commonly used to mark a location within
a document.&nbsp; Once a task has been created, it appears in the Task
view.&nbsp; If this task is selected (via double clicking), you should
reopen the editor at the location defined in the task. The focus should
be changed from the Task view to the editor.
<p>If appropriate, support for the creation of new task objects in an editor
should be implemented by the editor.&nbsp; For more information on this,
see <a href="#Editors">Editors</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Adding F1 Help to Task View</h4>
Plug-ins should support F1 keyboard command and link it to an infopop that
gives a detailed description of the selected item in the Task view.

<h3>
<a NAME="The Preference Dialog"></a>The Preference Dialog</h3>
The Preference Dialog is used to edit the global preference for a feature
in the workbench.
<p>A new preference page should be created when you need to expose global
options to the user.&nbsp; For instance, the global preferences for Java
compilation are exposed as a group of preference pages in the Preference
Dialog.&nbsp; If these preferences are changed, they affect the entire
Java plug-in.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
15.1</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Global options should be exposed within
the Preferences Dialog.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
A preference page should not be used to expose the local options for a
particular instance of a view, editor, or window.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this situation,
the user will look to the menu and toolbar of the control itself to customize
it.&nbsp; If these options are exposed in the Preference Dialog, it will
blur the location of customization, and confuse the user.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline

<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Expose the preferences for a particular
view, editor or window in the view itself, via a menu or tool item.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>

<h4>
Preference Page Design</h4>
In the simplest case, any plug-in which needs to expose an option to the
user will define a single preference page.&nbsp; This preference page should
contain all of the options for the plug-in, until the number of options
starts to overload the page.&nbsp; At that point a nested design for preference
pages should be adopted.
<p><img src="images/guidelineIndicator.gif" height="16" width="16"><b><font color="#09448D">Guideline
15.3</font></b>
<blockquote><font color="#09448D">Start out with a single preference page.&nbsp;
Then evolve to more if you need to.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
In a nested design, a root preference page is added to the preference dialog,
and then sub pages are added to the root preference page.&nbsp; The root
preference page should never be blank.&nbsp; Instead, it should contain
the most commonly used preferences, or those preferences which have a wide
spread effect upon the plug-in behavior.&nbsp; Beneath the root page, a
sub page should be created for each major chunk of functionality within
the plug-in.
<p>There is no reason to set the focus in a preference page, because focus
is always set to the tree, by the Eclipse platform, after the preference
page is made visible.

the root page for frequently used preferences, or those preferences which
have wide spread effect.&nbsp; Specialize within the sub pages. The root
preference page should not be blank.</font></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>

<p><br>Each new plug-in should integrate its plug-in preferences, wizards,
and views into existing preference, wizard, and view categories where it
makes sense, rather than the blind creation of new categories for itself.

<h3>
<a NAME="Outline"></a>The Outline View</h3>
In Eclipse, there is a special relationship between an editor and the Outline
view.&nbsp; When an editor is opened, the Outline view will connect to
the editor, and ask it for an outline model.&nbsp; If the editor answers
an outline model, that model will be displayed in the Outline view whenever
the editor is active.&nbsp; The outline is used to navigate through the
edit data, or interact with the edit data at a higher level of abstraction.
<p>If you are an editor developer, the relationship between an editor and
the Outline view is important.&nbsp; For more information on the collaboration
between these two, see <a href="#Editors">Editors</a>.
<p>

<h3>
<a NAME="The Properties View"></a>The Properties View</h3>
The Properties view shows the properties for the active part in the workbench,
or the selection within that part. These properties are supplied by the
active part itself.&nbsp; The Properties view is simply a container for
their presentation.
<p>Within Eclipse, the properties for an object can be exposed using a
Properties dialog, or the Properties view.&nbsp; The Properties view is
commonly used to edit the properties for a set of objects in an editor,
where quick access to the properties is important, and you switch from
one object to another quickly.
<p>For more information on the use of the Properties view, or Properties
dialog, refer to <a href="#Properties">Properties</a>.
<p>

<h3>
<a NAME="Bookmarks"></a>The Bookmarks View</h3>
The Bookmarks view is used to bookmark files, and open them quickly.&nbsp;
A plug-in developer may contribute new bookmarks to the workspace, and
rely upon the Bookmarks view to display those bookmarks.&nbsp; You can
also contribute new actions to the menu, toolbar, and context menu.&nbsp;
This is done by adding an extension to the plug-in registry.
<p>In an editor, bookmark objects are commonly used to mark a location
within a document.&nbsp; Once a bookmark has been created, it appears in
the Bookmarks view.&nbsp; If this bookmark is selected, you&nbsp; may reopen
the editor at the location defined in the bookmark.
<p>If appropriate, support for the creation of new bookmark objects should
be implemented by the editor.&nbsp; For more information on this, see <a href="#Editors">Editors</a>.
<p>

<h3>
<a NAME="Text Editor"></a>The Text Editor</h3>

This is done by adding an extension to the plug-in registry. For more information
on this, see <a href="#Editors">Editors</a>.
<p>

<h3>
<a NAME="Resource Perspective"></a>The Resource Perspective</h3>
The Resource perspective contains a Navigator, Outline, Task view, and
editor area.&nbsp; Plug-in developers may contribute a new command, action
set, or view to the Resource perspective.&nbsp; For more information, refer
to
<a href="#Perspectives">Perspectives</a>..

<h2>
<a NAME="Flat Look Design"></a>Flat Look Design</h2>

The Eclipse platform provides a Web user interface, also known as Flat Look, design
alternative for implementing content editors. For example, the editor in the
Eclipse plug-in development environment (PDE) perspective uses Flat Look.

<p><img src="images/flatlook1.gif" hspace="40" height=597 width=789>
<p>

The Flat Look design may be more suitable for certain type of user tasks,
and more appealing to certain user profile.
However, this design should not be used just because it provides a different look
than the native platform look and feel. The use of Flat Look design should be
considered in the context of the supported user scenarios. This design is usually
a good fit for extensive property and configuration editing, such as editing
Eclipse's plugin.xml file, and J2EE Web application's deployment descriptors.

<h2>
<a NAME="The Tao of IResource"></a>The Tao of Resource</h2>
In Eclipse, the notion of a tool disappears.&nbsp; In its place, is the
idea of a universal tool platform - an open, extensible IDE - where tool
plug-ins are added to extend the capabilities of the platform.&nbsp; These
plug-ins "teach" Eclipse how to work with things - java files, web content,
graphics, video - almost anything you can imagine.&nbsp; At an implementation
level, these plug-ins communicate using resources (projects, folders, and
files).&nbsp; The resource is the common medium for integration between
plugins and external tools.
<p>The resource concept was developed for a number of reasons:
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
Integration between a plug-in from one vendor, and a plug-in from another,
is only possible if there is a common, well known data abstraction.</li>

<li>
Integration with external tools is only possible if everything, at some
level, is a file.</li>
</ol>

<p><br>Resources are also important at the UI level.&nbsp; If an object
command, decorator, or property page contribution is made to an IResource,
the platform will ensure that this contribution is visible in any view
or editor where the resource appears.&nbsp; For instance, a .java file
will be visible in the Navigator, the Hierarchy view, and the Packages
view.&nbsp; To the user, the .java file is the same object, regardless
of the view where it appears, so the object appearance, context menu, and
properties should be consistent in each view.
<p>In some cases, the implementation of a particular view or editor may
wrap a resource within another object, for presentation purposes.&nbsp;
If the wrapper is equivalent to a resource, it is important to expose this
equivalence to the platform.&nbsp; If the resource is exposed, the platform
may apply resource contributions to the resource equivalent object.&nbsp;
This ensures presentation consistency for an object in the platform.
<p>The underlying resource for an object is exposed by implementing IAdaptable
on the model object, and answering an IContributorResourceAdapter.&nbsp;
For more information on the implementation of an IContributorResourceAdapter,
refer to Eclipse Corner.

<h2>
<a NAME="Best Practices"></a>Best Practices</h2>
<p>


In this section, we provide examples of best practices for designing and implementing
some common user interactions within the Eclipse platform.

<p>

<h4>
<a NAME="BP:Syntax and Compilation Error Handling"></a>Syntax and Compilation Error Handling</h4>

When designing editors that provide syntax or compilation checking support,
follow the Java tooling design in the Eclipse platform.

<p>
Provide on the fly syntax checking if possible. Use red "squiggle" to indicate where
the potential error is located in the source code. Use a red box on the side bar on the
right side to indicate the approximate error position in the file. Use a prominent marker
on the upper right hand corner to indicate that the file contains errors or warnings.
Use red color to indicate errors, and use yellow to indicate warnings.

<p><img src="images/bp1.gif" hspace="40" height=597 width=789>

<p>
After users perform a save operation, user a more prominent marker on the left hand side
margin to indicate errors and warnings in the file. When using the mouse pointer to hover
over the marker, the description text should be displayed. In addition, show the 
icon decorator in the content editor tab. In the tree view that shows the resource in
the Eclipse workspace, use icon decorator to indicate errors or warnings associated
with this resource, and propagate the icon decorator indication up to the parents
of the resource in the tree view. Finally, an entry should be added to the Task view
to list the errors and warnings.

<p><img src="images/bp2.gif" hspace="40" height=597 width=789>

<h4>
<a NAME="BP:Coding Assistance"></a>Coding Assistance</h4>
In addition to supporting the standard content assist in an editor, editors should
exploit the use of Quick Fixes and Quick Assist. Use the light bulb marker on the
left hand side margin to provide suggestions on how to fix problems with the
source code. Users can click on the light bulb or use Edit -> Quick Fix menu item
to invoke this command.

<p><img src="images/bp3.gif" hspace="40" height=597 width=789>

<p>
Even when there are no syntax errors in the file, users should be able to obtain
certain quick assistance with their code using the Quick Fix mechanism.
For example, assigning an expression to a local variable.

<p><img src="images/bp4.gif" hspace="40" height=597 width=789>


<p><hr>
<p>
If an editor is used for writing code in a given programming language,
hyper-linked code support should be enabled. While using the mouse pointer
to hover over the source code, pressing the Ctrl key will turn the programming language
constructs such as class, method, and field identifiers into clickable links
to the corresponding declaration.


<p><img src="images/bp5.gif" hspace="40" height=597 width=789>

<p><hr>
<p>
When possible, a plug-in should provide refactoring support at the programming
language or application development level. For example, if users rename a method in
a Java class, refactoring support should enable users to automatically find and
fix up all references. If users change the URL for a given resource in a Web
application, refactoring support should enable users to automatically update
the references to the modified URL.

<p><img src="images/bp6.gif" hspace="40" height=597 width=789>


<h4>
<a NAME="BP:Context Menu"></a>Context Menu</h4>
Here is one suggested process to reason why a menu item should be added or
removed from the context menu. The objective is to reduce the number of
context menu items to no more than 20.

<p>
First, remove menu items that are not sensitive to selections.
Second, remove menu items that are not frequently used.
Third,?examine the items that are not sensitive?to selection
but are frequently used. Add at most of 5 of these items back.
Fourth,?remove all disabled menu items, except for clipboard operations
such as copy and paste, and team, compare and replace submenus.
Fifth, remove menu items that are frequently used, selection sensitive,
but have a dominant keyboard shortcut key defined, except for
clipboard and save operations.


<h4>
<a NAME="BP:Labels, Fonts and Layout for Flat Look Design"></a>
Labels, Fonts and Layout for Flat Look Design</h4>

For Flat Look design, when using buttons with ellipses
(except for the "More..." button), it should pop up a secondary window
which can be a dialog box or a wizard.

<p>
Use Title capitalization for section titles.
The distance between section columns should be 32 pixels.

<p>
On pages with listbox on the left hand side,
the distance be between the list box and the right-hand column
(e.g. showing properties for a selected listbox item) should be 10 pixels.

<p><img src="images/flatlook7.gif" hspace="40" height=285 width=321>

<p><hr>
<p>

<p>
For labels and fields, use RGB value (160, 160, 164) for enabled state,
RBG value (0, 0, 0) for read-only state, and RBG value (128, 128, 128) for disabled state.


<p><img src="images/flatlook8.gif" hspace="40" height=138 width=600>

<p>
For listbox control, use RBG value (0, 0, 0) for the border to indicate enabled state,
use RBG value (128, 128, 128) for disabled state.


<p><img src="images/flatlook9.gif" hspace="40" height=368 width=384></p>

<p>
<h4>
<a NAME="BP:Decorators"></a>
Decorators</h4>

Enabling and disabling the decorators are extremely useful when the decorations performed by two or more decorators conflict with each other. For example, the CVS plug-in might decorate the base image by superimposing the base image with a custom image while the &quot;Decorate Example&quot; plug-in might superimpose a different custom image at the same position thereby conflicting with the CVS plug-in decoration. If the decoration performed by two different decorators on the same resource conflict, users should appropriately enable / disable different decorators to get the required decoration.
<p>
Implementation tip:<br>
It is very important to design custom decorators that don't conflict with basic decorations provided by different Eclipse views. For example, the package explorer view decorates Java files with problem markers (a problem marker is placed at the bottom left hand corner) if there are compilation errors. It is a bad practice to decorate resources with custom decoration exactly at the position of a problem marker and developers should avoid this. If the custom decoration is performed at the bottom left corner, then custom decoration and the problem marker decoration, if any, conflict each other and hence users will not be able to view the decorations. The solution to the above mentioned problem is to provide a custom image decoration at the bottom right corner which does not conflict with the basic image decoration provided by Eclipse. The top left corner is the second best place although it conflicts with the binary project decorator. The bottom left and top right should be avoided as they are decorated outside of the decorator mechanism

<dt>
<b>Command</b></dt>

<dd>
A <i>command</i>, which is invoked by a user to carry out some specific functions, may appear as an item in a menu, or an item in a toolbar.  In reflection of this, it has attributes for the menu or tool item label, tooltip, and image. 
As a plug-in developer, you can contribute commands to the window menu bar and toolbar, or to individual views and editors.  Contribution to the window is performed using an <i>action set</i>, a set of task oriented commands which the user can show or hide.  Contribution to a view or editor is performed using individual command.

<dt>
<b>Bookmarks View</b></dt>

<dd>
A view used to browse the bookmarks in the workbench.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Editor</b></dt>

<dd>
An editor is a visual component within a workbench page. It is typically
used to edit or browse a document or input object. The input is identified
using an &lt;code>IEditorInput&lt;/code>.&nbsp; Modifications made in an
editor part follow an open-save-close lifecycle model (in contrast to a
view part, where modifications are saved to the workbench immediately).</dd>

<br>&nbsp;

<b>File</b></dt>

<dd>
An object in the workspace, analogous to files in the file system.</dd>

<b>Outline View</b></dt>

<dd>
A view, commonly used to view the outline of the active editor.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Perspective</b></dt>

<dd>
A perspective is a visual container for a set of views and editors (parts).&nbsp;
These parts exist wholly within the perspective and are not shared.&nbsp;
A perspective is also like a page within a book.&nbsp; It exists within
a window along with any number of other perspectives and, like a page within
a book, only one perspective is visible at any time.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Platform</b></dt>

<dd>
A generic framework for the integration of tools.</dd>

A Preference Page is used to edit the preferences for a feature in the
platform.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;

<b>Tasks View</b></dt>

<dd>
A view used to browse the tasks, errors, and warnings within the workspace.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>View</b></dt>

<dd>
A view is a visual component within a workbench page.&nbsp; It is typically
used to navigate a hierarchy of information (like the workspace), open
an editor, or display properties for the active editor.&nbsp; Modifications
made in a view are saved immediately (in contrast to an editor part, which
conforms to a more elaborate open-save-close lifecycle).</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Wizard</b></dt>

<dd>
A Wizard is typically used to create new resources, import resources, or
export resources.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Workbench</b></dt>

<dd>
The Workbench provides the user interface structure for Eclipse. The purpose
of the Workbench is to facilitate the seamless integration of tools. These
tools contribute to extension points defined by the Workbench.&nbsp; The
Workbench is responsible for the presentation and coordination of the user
interface.</dd>

<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>Workspace</b></dt>

<dd>
The various tools plugged in to the Eclipse Platform operate on regular
files in the user's workspace.&nbsp; The workspace consists of one or more
top level projects, where each project maps to a corresponding user specified
directory in the file system.&nbsp; Each project contains a collection
of folders and files.</dd>
