		The Faceted Project Framework allows the plug-in developer to
		think of Web Tools Platform (WTP) projects as composed of units
		of functionality, otherwise known as facets, that can be added
		and removed by the user. This tutorial walks you through an
		example of creating a couple of basic facets and in the process
		covers the majority of the framework's extension points. This
		tutorial has been written for version 1.5 of the Web Tools
		Platform.
