		OpenGL is a vendor-neutral, multi-platform standard for creating
		high-performance 2D and 3D graphics. Hardware and software
		implementations exist on various operating systems, including Windows,
		Linux and MacOS. OpenGL may be used to render simple 2D charts or
		complex 3D games. This article describes an experimental Eclipse plug-in
		that facilitates the use of OpenGL for drawing onto SWT widgets. A short
		history and overview of OpenGL is presented, followed by an example
		application.
