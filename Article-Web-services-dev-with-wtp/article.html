<h1>Introduction </h1>
<p> The Web Tools Platform (WTP) Project extends Eclipse with a set of open-source 
  Web services development tools and API's. This tutorial gives an overview of 
  the project and focuses on its Web Services support.</p>
<p>At present the project is divided into three sub projects:</p>
<p> • Web Standard Tools (WST)<br>
  • J2EE Standard Tools (JST)<br>
  • Java Server Faces Tools (JSF) </p>
<p>The Web Standard Tools subproject contains support for XML Web services, including 
  tools based on standards defined by the W3C, Oasis, WS-I and others. WS-I is 
  an open industry organization chartered to promote Web services interoperability 
  across platforms, operating systems and programming languages. The organization’s 
  diverse community of Web services leaders helps customers to develop interoperable 
  Web services by providing guidance, recommended practices and supporting resources.</p>
<p>The J2EE Standard Tools subproject contains support for standards defined by 
  the Java Community Process, such as JAX-RPC and JSR-109, and for reference implementations 
  of these standards, such as Apache Axis. The project contains both a set of 
  tools for Web services developers and a set of API's for Web services tool creators.</p>
<p>The Java Server Faces Tools project will provide tools and API's for JSR 127 
  which is part of Java EE 5. The project will operate as an incubator during 
  the WTP 1.0 development cycle and will become a component of the JST subproject 
  in WTP 1.5.</p>
<p>Collectively, these three sub projects include tools for HTML, XML, Web Services, 
  J2EE and JSF development along with Server tools for integrating application 
  servers, including Apache Tomcat, Apache Geronimo, JBoss, IBM WebSphere and 
  BEA WebLogic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/tip.gif" width="62" height="13"> This tutorial uses the Eclipse 
  Web Tools Platform 1.0 and Apache Tomcat 5.5 for it's demonstrations. The locations 
  for downloads are given in the <em><strong>References and Resources </strong></em>section 
  at the end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Building a 'Stock Quote' Web Service Client Using the Eclipse WTP</h1>
<p> Although WTP provides many tools that are useful in Web Application development, 
  this tutorial will focus on the tools that are directly related to Web Services 
  development, testing and deployment. These tools, mostly integrated under the 
  Web Standards Tools sub project, are;</p>
<p> 1. Web Service Explorer<br>
  2. WSDL/XSD Editor<br>
  3. Web Service Wizard and<br>
  4. WS-I Test Tools <br>
</p>
<p>In the following sections of this tutorial, we will look into the usage of 
  these tools in Web Services development. We will consider a scenario where we 
  are entrusted to implement a Web Service client for a 'Stock Quote' service. 
  Using the Eclipse WTP, we will;</p>
<ul>
  <li> Search for an exposed 'Stock Quote' service in a UDDI registry,</li>
  <li>Access the WSDL for this service,</li>
  <li>Import the WSDL to the Eclipse WTP workbench,</li>
  <li>Generate code (stubs) using the WSDL,</li>
  <li>Test the service and finally</li>
  <li>Validate WS-I compliance</li>
</ul>
<p>At each stage of the tutorial, we will look at a demonstration of how the activities 
  described can be done in the Eclipse WTP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Finding a candidate service using the 'Web Services Explorer'</h2>
<p> The Web Services Explorer helps in the <em><strong>Discovery</strong></em>,<em><strong> 
  Testing </strong></em>and<em><strong> Publishing</strong></em> of Web Services. 
  In order to build a client, we need to first find an exposed Web Service, which 
  satisfies our requirements. After finding several candidates from the published 
  UDDI registry information, it is only natural to test the functionality of the 
  methods provided by the services. The 'Web Services Explorer' provided by the 
  Eclipse WTP provides support for each of these actions as outlined below.<br>
</p>
<p> <strong>1. Discovery</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> Searching UDDI Registries </li>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>UDDI is an acronym for Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration. 
      A platform-independent, XML-based registry for businesses worldwide to list 
      themselves on the Internet. UDDI is an open industry initiative (sponsored 
      by OASIS) enabling businesses to publish service listings and discover each 
      other and define how the services or software applications interact over 
      the Internet. A UDDI business registration consists of three components:</p>
    <p> 1. White Pages - address, contact, and known identifiers;<br>
      2. Yellow Pages - industrial categorizations based on standard taxonomies; 
      and<br>
      3. Green Pages - technical information about services exposed by the business</p>
    <p>UDDI is nominally one of the core Web Services standards. It is designed 
      to be interrogated by SOAP messages and to provide access to WSDL documents 
      describing the protocol bindings and message formats required to interact 
      with the web services listed in its directory.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <li> Navigating WSIL (Web Services Inspection Language) Documents </li>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>WS-Inspection is a web service specification for &quot;discovery documents&quot; 
      developed in a joint effort by Microsoft and IBM. WS-Inspection lists groups 
      of web services and their endpoints in an XML format. Currently, other standards 
      are being used for this purpose, such as Microsoft's DISCO. It is expected 
      that WS-Inspection will eventually replace these standards to become the 
      universally accepted discovery standard for web services.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <li> Importing WSDL into development project 
    <blockquote> 
      <p>The Web Services Description Language (WSDL) is an XML format published 
        for describing Web services. Version V 1.1 has not been endorsed by the 
        World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), however it has released a draft for version 
        2.0 on May 11, 2005, that will be a W3C recommendation, and thus endorsed 
        by the W3C.<br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Test</strong><br>
  • Dynamic invocation based on WSDL<br>
  • View SOAP messages<br>
</p>
<p><strong>3. Publish</strong><br>
  • Publish WSDL into UDDI Registries</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the demonstration below we will 'search' a UDDI registry using the Eclipse 
  WTP and filter the results, in order to obtain a viable candidate service for 
  our client. Then we will invoke some 'service operations' to check the actual 
  outputs and finally 'import' the service WSDL to our workbench.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Demonstration</h3>
<h4> Launching the Web Services Explorer</h4>
<p><img src="images/tryit.gif" width="61" height="13"> Make sure that you are 
  in the <em><strong>J2EE Perspective</strong></em> in Eclipse. In the J2EE perspective, 
  clicking the 'Launch Web Services Explorer' button in the Eclipse WTP tool bar 
  will launch the Web Services Explorer in your default web browser (in this instance, 
  Mozilla Firefox). The default registry queried is the IBM Test UDDI registry. 
</p>

<p>Figure 1 - Eclipse WTP workbench with the ' <em><strong>Launch Web Services 
  Explorer</strong></em>' button highlighted </p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Web Services Explorer Launched In the Eclipse WTP</h4>
<p>In this tutorial we will use the 'XMethods' UDDI registry to get ourselves 
  familiar with the Web Services Explorer. </p>
<p><img src="images/tryit.gif" width="61" height="13"> Select the registry from 
  the drop down list, register for an account, activate the account and we are 
  ready to move forward.<br>
  Click the 'Go' button to begin exploring the registry.</p>
<h4><img src="images/web-service-explorer.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></h4>
<p>Figure 2 - The Web Services Explorer<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Searching For Exposed Web Services in the UDDI registry<br>
</h4>
<p>After accessing the registry, we need to find a Web Service to work with. </p>
<p><img src="images/tryit.gif" width="61" height="13"> Click the 'Find' button 
  and type 'Stock Quote Services' as the <em><strong>name of this query</strong></em>. 
  In the <em><strong>name</strong></em> text box, type 'Stock Quote' (which we 
  know exists). In the combo box you get three selections as <em><strong>Businesses</strong></em>, 
  <em> <strong>Services</strong></em> or <em><strong>Service Interfaces</strong></em>. 
  Select ‘Services’ there. Click ‘Go’ to execute the search.</p>
<p><img src="images/search-services.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>

<p>Figure 4 - Search query results displayed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/tryit.gif" width="61" height="13"> Click on one of the results 
  to view service information. Then click 'Add To WSDL Page' to add this service 
  to the WSDL page to further explore it.</p>
<p><img src="images/service-details-displayed.jpg" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Figure 5 - Add to WSDL action selected</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4> Invoking Service Operations Available for Developers</h4>
<p>We can explore and invoke WSDL operations in the WSDL Page. In this particular 
  service, we can invoke the operation available to get a Stock Quote for a given 
  symbol string. This is good because we can actually try out the service methods 
  and verify whether the expected output is provided by them.</p>
<p><img src="images/tryit.gif" width="61" height="13"> Type 'IBM' and check the 
  'Status' panel for the returned data.</p>

<p>Figure 6 - Invoking a WSDL operation</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Importing the Service WSDL to the Workbench</h4>
<p> After exploring and finding our services, the next step is to start using 
  them in our Web Applications. In order to do this, we need to create Client 
  stubs along with <em>Web Service Emulators</em> (to test our clients). Using 
  the Eclipse WTP we can import the WSDL of the Web Service explored into the 
  workbench. </p>
<p><img src="images/tryit.gif" width="61" height="13"> Let's try this using the 
  steps below.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> 1. Create a simple project in your Eclipse WTP workbench (Ex: WTPtutorial)<br>
    2. Click 'Import WSDL To Workbench' button in the web services explorer, as 
    illustrated below<br>
    3. Select the appropriate project to import the WSDL to (in this instance, 
    WTPtutorial)<br>
    4. Give a name to the generated WSDL file in the project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Editing Documents with the WSDL/XSD Editor</h2>
<p>As described previously, The Web Services Description Language (WSDL) is the 
  XML format published for describing Web services. WSDL describes the public 
  interface to the web service. This is an XML-based service description on how 
  to communicate using the web service; namely, the protocol bindings and message 
  formats required to interact with the web services listed in its directory. 
  The supported operations and messages are described abstractly, and then bound 
  to a concrete network protocol and message format.</p>
<p>WSDL is often used in combination with SOAP and XML Schema to provide web services 
  over the internet. A client program connecting to a web service can read the 
  WSDL to determine what functions are available on the server. Any special data 
  types used are embedded in the WSDL file in the form of XML Schema. The client 
  can then use SOAP to actually call one of the functions listed in the WSDL.</p>
<p>An XML Schema Definition (XSD) is an instance of an XML schema written in the 
  W3C's XML Schema language. An XSD defines a type of XML document in terms of 
  constraints upon what elements and attributes may appear, their relationship 
  to each other, what types of data may be in them, and other things.<br>
</p>
<p> The WSDL/XSD Editor provided by the Eclipse WTP provides the developer with 
  functionality expected from an advanced editor such as;<br>
</p>
<p>• Graphical and Source editing modes<br>
  • Seamless integration for editing inline XSD<br>
  • Content Assist<br>
  • Pop-up actions<br>
  • Binding Wizard<br>
  • Validation, including WS-I profiles<br>
  • Extensible for WSDL extension elements</p>
<p>Illustrated below is the WSDL imported from the above section. It is displayed 
  in the WSDL editor running in ‘<em><strong>graphical</strong></em>’ mode.</p>

<h3>WSDL Editor Demonstration</h3>
<p><br>
  <img src="images/tryit.gif" width="61" height="13"> We will try the editor following 
  the steps below.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><br>
    1. Open “StockQuote.wsdl” in WSDL Editor<br>
    2. Go into graphical view of XML schema for messages<br>
    3. Navigate into “GetQuote” element<br>
    4. Switch to Source tab<br>
    5. Navigate using linked Outline and Properties views</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the illustration below, we can see the editor in 'Source' mode along with 
  the Eclipse workbench content outline.</p>

<h2>Generating Code Using the Web Services Wizard</h2>
<p> The next stage in the tutorial is to start creating and accessing web services. 
  The Eclipse WTP Web Services Wizard provides the tools for doing just that. 
</p>
<p>The wizard;<br>
</p>
<p> 1. Supports generate/deploy/test/publish lifecycle<br>
  2. Configures project, server, and SOAP engine<br>
  3. Has highly extensible
<ul>
  <li> SOAP engines</li>
  <li> Code generators</li>
  <li> Test facilities </li>
</ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Web Services Client Wizard Demonstration</h3>
<p> In this demonstration, we will create a Web Service client for our 'Stock 
  Quote' service. We will follow the Generate, Deploy, Test and Publish life cycle. 
</p>
<h4><br>
  1. Configuring the Server</h4>
<p> First we must configure our server in the Eclipse WTP workbench. This demonstration 
  will use the Apache Tomcat server. </p>
<p><img src="images/tryit.gif" width="61" height="13"> Go to the Menu File -&gt; 
  New -&gt; Other and Select Servers. Fill your server information as illustrated 
  in the Add New Server wizard.</p>

<h4><br>
  2. Complete the Web Services Wizard</h4>
<p> <img src="images/tryit.gif" width="61" height="13"> The steps are illustrated 
  in the following screen shots. They can be briefly outlined as;</p>
<p>1. Run Web Service Client Wizard to generate Java proxy and JSP test page with 
  TCP/IP monitor<br>
  Go to Menu File -&gt; New -&gt; Other. Expand '<em><strong>Web Services</strong></em>'. 
  Select '<strong><em>Web Service Client</em></strong>'. Click 'Next'.</p>

<p>Figure 17 - Start the Tomcat server </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. In this screen select the option 'Run test on server', since it's not selected 
  by default. This will enable us to test the Web service in our Tomcat server 
  with the Eclipse WTP generated JSP's. Click 'Finish' to complete the wizard.</p>

<p>Figure 19 - The generated code, displayed in the workbench</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. Test the Generated Client Stubs</h4>
<p><img src="images/tryit.gif" width="61" height="13"> Here we are setting the 
  end point of the web service (using setEndPoinnt() method) as ‘http://localhost:9913/stockquote.asmx’ 
  instead of ‘http://www.webservicex.com/stockquote.asmx’. We do this in order 
  to monitor our SOAP requests using TCP/IP monitor.</p>
<p><img src="images/test-generated-stubs-1.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Figure 20 - Testing using the generated JSP's hosted in the Tomcat server</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/tryit.gif" width="61" height="13"> Now go to the Menu Window 
  -&gt; Show View -&gt; Other. Expand Debug and select TCP/IP monitor. This will 
  launch the TCP/IP monitor GUI. Right click as illustrated and select Properties.</p>
<p><img src="images/test-generated-stubs-2.JPG" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Figure 21 - The TCP/IP monitor GUI</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/tryit.gif" width="61" height="13"> In the Properties dialog 
  click Add. In the next dialog, enter 9913 as monitoring port and the ‘real’ 
  end points details as illustrated below. Click OK and Start to begin monitoring.</p>
<p>What happens here is that, all requests going to the real endpoint will be 
  monitored by the TCP/IP monitor. Hence, we get the opportunity to intercept 
  and view all SOAP messages and debug if required.</p>

<p>Figure 22 - Port mapping in the TCP/IP monitor</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that we have all this set up, let’s fire a test and see everything in action. 
</p>
<p><img src="images/tryit.gif" width="61" height="13"> Right click the project 
  in the workbench. Click Run As -&gt; Run on Server. The test JSP page will come 
  up. Set the end point as described above. Make sure the TCP/IP monitor is configured 
  and running as illustrated above.</p>
<p><img src="images/tryit.gif" width="61" height="13"> Click on the getStockQuote() 
  method. Input a symbol (ex: ‘ibm’). If all is well you should get data similar 
  to the following screen shot.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Interoperability Using the WS-I Compliance Tools</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>What is WS-I?<br>
</h2>
<p>The Web Services Interoperability Organization is an open industry effort chartered 
  to promote Web Services interoperability across platforms, applications and 
  programming languages. It acts an a standards integrator to help Web services 
  advance in a structured, coherent manner. The WS-I consists of approximately 
  130 member organizations of which 70% are vendors and 30% are end-user organizations. 
  It has a strong non-U.S. membership, including the very influential Japan SIG.<br>
</p>
<h2>WS-I Goals</h2>
<p>1. Achieve Web services interoperability by integrating specifications, promoting 
  consistent implementations and providing a visible representation of conformance.<br>
  2. Accelerate Web services deployment by offering implementation guidance and 
  best practices, delivering tools and sample applications and providing a implementer’s 
  forum where developers can collaborate.<br>
  3. Encourage Web services adoption by building industry consensus to reduce 
  early adopter risks, providing a forum for end users to communicate requirements 
  and raising awareness of customer business requirements</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The WS-I Compliance tools in Eclipse WTP helps the developer to verify interoperability 
  of the web services developed. These tools are developed in the Eclipse Web 
  Service Validation Tools (WSVT) Project and supports;</p>
<p> • WS-I Basic Profile 1.0/1.1<br>
  • Simple SOAP Binding Profile 1.0 and <br>
  • Attachments Profile 1.0</p>
<p>The Eclipse WTP provides us with;</p>
<p> 1. A WSDL 1.1 Validator and<br>
  2. A SOAP 1.1 Message Monitor/Analyzer</p>

<h1>Conclusion </h1>
<p> This tutorial illustrated a common life cycle of a Web Services application, 
  in order to highlight the support rendered in its development, from the Eclipse 
  Web Tools platform. This tutorial is in no way complete, since it would require
