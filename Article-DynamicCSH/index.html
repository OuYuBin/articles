<h1>Dynamic User Assistance in Eclipse-Based Applications</h1>
<div class="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Development environments have become very complex. As a result, providing users with 
context relevant assistance is critical to helping them succeed with your tools and 
applications. This article will introduce you to Eclipse's powerful Dynamic Assistance 
framework and provide examples that illustrate how you can take full advantage of its 
capabilities.</p>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>For years, software developers have looked for better ways to provide users with more timely information to help them be successful.  
       Why?  If users have to regularly engage and hunt through a large Help system, they'll become frustrated.  Opening the Help 
       system is an overt action that the user must take to get information.  Because it is an overt action, it interrupts the user's task.</p>
      <p>From a usability perspective, it would be much more efficient for the user if context-relevant information were dynamically presented, 
        immediately available, and easily visible while the user continues to work.  If information could be presented in this fashion, users 
        would be able to engage targeted information without significant disruption to their tasks.  The challenge has been that mechanisms 
        for presenting information in this fashion have been lacking.  Fortunately, the latest versions of Eclipse include new (and evolving) 
        mechanisms for providing dynamic context-sensitive help.</p>
      <p>To help you understand and leverage these mechanisms, this article will begin by providing a few simple examples of the basic 
        context-sensitive help found in Eclipse, discussing them from the user's perspective.  Next, we'll look at a simple example of how you 
        can take advantage of Eclipse's help framework directly, with no additional programming required.  Finally, we'll use a small sample 
        application (based on the sample EMF Library Editor) to describe how you can extend the basic capabilities provided by Eclipse, thereby 
        significantly increasing the extent to which your can provide dynamic context-sensitive information.  For this example, we 
	  implement the following methods from the IContextProvider class:
	  <ul>
	  <li>getContextChangeMask - This method returns flags indicating which types of events should trigger a context help update.</li>
	  <li>getContext - This method returns a help context for the given target. The number of times this method will be called depends on the 
	  context change mask. Static context providers will be called each time the owner of the target is activated. If change triggers are used, 
	  the method will be called each time the trigger occurs.</li>
	  <li>getSearchExpression - This method returns a search expression that finds more information about the current target. It can be used to 
	  return results for the Dynamic Help section of the Help view.  We will discuss this method towards the end of the article.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

      <h2>The User's Experience of Context-Sensitive Help </h2>
      <p>The basic intent of context sensitive help is to be able to present the user with a small amount of relevant information based on the 
        objects that they are currently engaging within the product user interface (UI).  Eclipse's basic context-sensitive help capabilities allow 
        you to create information about wizard pages, views, and editors.  By doing so, as the user moves from view to view or editor to editor, 
        the information presented in the Help view changes.</p>
      <p>To see this for yourself, follow these steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Open your Eclipse workbench.</li>
          <li>Switch to the Java perspective.</li>
          <li>Click <b>Help &gt; Dynamic Help</b> (the Help view opens).</li>
          <li>Select the <b>Hierarchy view</b>.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>If the dynamic help view is your default context-sensitive help mechanism (Windows &gt; Preferences &gt; Help), the Help view should 
        now look something like Figure 1.</p>  
        <p>If you select various views and editors in your workbench, you will notice that the two sections of the 
        Help view change.  The top section, About Hierarchy view, describes the Hierarchy view and provides a few targeted links where 
        additional information is available. The next section, called Dynamic Help, provides a longer list of links.  This set of links is the result 
        of an automatic search query that is built and run by the Eclipse dynamic assistance framework.  The basic query combines the view or 
        editor name, and the current perspective, performs a search of the Help system, and returns the top items from the results list.</p>
      
        <br /><a name="fig1"><b>Figure 1. The Help View</b></a><br />
        <img src="images/figure1.jpg" width="267" height="426" alt="The Help VIew"/>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>In addition to providing context-sensitive help for views and editors, it can also be very useful for wizards.  To see this for yourself, follow
        these steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Select <b>File &gt; New &gt; Project</b>. The New Project wizard appears.</li>
          <li>Select the <b>question mark icon</b> in the lower left corner of the wizard.  A Help view appears, attached to the wizard.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>Figure 2 shows the New Project wizard with context-sensitive help opened.</p>
      
        <br /><a name="fig2"><b>Figure 2. The New Project Wizard</b></a><br />
        <img src="images/figure2.jpg" width="535" height="504" alt="The New Project Wizard"/>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>To see how the help content changes, select a <b>project type</b> from the list and then select <b>Next</b>.  The help on the second page of 
        the wizard will now include elements related to the type of project selected.</p>
      <p>For example, Figure 3 shows the help found on page two of this wizard, assuming you selected an Eclipse Modeling Framework 
        (EMF) project.  The Dynamic Help section changes to show items which relate to EMF based projects.</p>
      
        <br /><a name="fig3"><b>Figure 3. New EMF Project</b></a><br />
        <img src="images/figure3.jpg" width="533" height="572" alt="New EMF Project"/>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>The Help view can be particularly powerful for new users, who often become confused by the wide array of views, perspectives, and 
        wizards that are available.</p>
      <p>The next section of this article will describe how you can take advantage of this basic capability.</p>
      <p><a name="d0e309"><span class="atitle">Creating Context-Sensitive Help for Wizards, Views and Editors</span></a></p>
      <p>Since Eclipse handles the infrastructure for us, we only have to define three things: a unique identifier (known as a context ID), the place 
        we want a particular context-sensitive help topic to be available, and the contents of the help topic.  The first two are generally done by a code 
        developer, and the third part is generally done by a user assistance developer or documentation writer.</p>
      <p>To attach a context-sensitive help topic to a wizard page, for example, we first need to define a unique context ID.  A context ID is a 
        string that serves as an identifier connecting the UI and a particular help topic; it can contain letters, numbers, and the underscore 
        character.  To allow the help topic to exist in a separate plugin (an arrangement that has many advantages), we need to make the context 
        ID "fully qualified," which means that we want to prepend the code plugin's plugin ID.</p> 
        <p>So, for our example wizard page, the fully qualified 
        context ID is "org.eclipse.ui.ide.new_project_wizard_page_context".  This value is set 
        in org.eclipse.ui.internal.ide/IIDEHelpContextIds.java (where the string IDEWorkbenchPlugin.IDE_WORKBENCH is 
        set to equal "org.eclipse.ui.ide", the plugin ID for this code plugin).</p>      
      <br /><pre>  
        public interface IIDEHelpContextIds {
        	public static final String PREFIX = IDEWorkbenchPlugin.IDE_WORKBENCH + ".";
        	public static final String NEW_PROJECT_WIZARD_PAGE = PREFIX
        	+ "new_project_wizard_page_context";  
      </pre><br />
      <p>The fully qualified context ID is now defined and contained in a string named "IIDEHelpContextIds.NEW_PROJECT_WIZARD_PAGE".</p>
      <p>The second step is to attach the context ID to the wizard page.  In the WizardNewProjectCreationPage.java file that defines the wizard page, 
        this is done with the setHelp() method:</p>
      <br /><pre>
        public class WizardNewProjectCreationPage extends WizardPage {
        	...
        	public void createControl(Composite parent) {
        	Composite composite = new Composite(parent, SWT.NULL);
        	...
        	PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getHelpSystem().setHelp(composite,
        	IIDEHelpContextIds.NEW_PROJECT_WIZARD_PAGE);
      </pre><br />
      <p>If you're wondering why the <code>setHelp</code> method doesn't just refer to fully qualified context ID itself, it is possible to 
        do that, but if the code ever were to move to a different plugin or the plugin were renamed, it would be more difficult to find and change all the 
        context ID declarations.</p>
      <p>Now we just need to create the context-sensitive help topic.  This final step involves two XML files: a plugin.xml file and a contexts file.  
        Let's look at the contexts file, contexts_Workbench.xml, first:</p>
      <br /><pre>
        &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
        &lt;contexts&gt;
          ...
          &lt;context id="new_project_wizard_page_context"&gt;
            &lt;description&gt;This wizard helps you create a new project in the
              workbench.&lt;/description&gt;
            &lt;topic href="reference/ref-37.htm" label="New Project Wizard"/&gt;
            &lt;topic href="concepts/concepts-12.htm" label="Resources"/&gt;
            &lt;topic href="tasks/tasks-42.htm" label="Creating Resources - Projects"/&gt;
          &lt;/context&gt;
          ...
        &lt;/contexts&gt;</pre><br />
      <p>This should look familiar.  A context element defines a single context-sensitive help topic.  The context ID is the one defined in the 
        developer's code above (only it is not fully qualified), and the description and topic elements contain the text and hyperlinks we saw 
        in Figure 3.  There's nothing else in a contexts file but these &lt;context&gt; elements, but you can put as many of them in one as you want.</p>
      <p>The last piece of the puzzle is identifying our contexts file in the plugin.xml file (the one in the same plugin as our contexts file).  
        That code looks like this:</p>
      <br /><pre>
        &lt;extension point="org.eclipse.help.contexts"&gt;
          &lt;contexts file="contexts_Workbench.xml" plugin="org.eclipse.ui.ide"/&gt;
        &lt;/extension&gt;</pre><br />
      <p>Since the contexts file and plugin.xml for this wizard exist in a separate plugin (org.eclipse.platform.doc.user) than the wizard 
        code (org.eclipse.ui.ide), the code plugin's plugin ID must be specified in the plugin attribute of the &lt;contexts&gt; element.</p>
      <p>That's it in a nutshell.  There are additional considerations, like how to organize dozens or even hundreds of these, or provide 
        National Language (translated) versions of them, but if you architect your context-sensitive help in this way, you're already set 
        up to handle those problems easily.</p>
     <p>What about attaching context-sensitive help to other things, like views and editors?  According to the Eclipse user assistance 
       on the subject, context IDs can be associated with a <code> Control, IAction, Menu, or MenuItem</code>.  (Other UI 
       elements cannot be associated with a context ID or cannot receive focus anyway, so assigning context IDs to them would be 
       pointless.)  Since views, editors, and wizards are simply different types of controls, declaring context IDs on views and editors 
       is virtually identical to the  method shown above.</p>
      <p>The primary limitation of the Eclipse context-sensitive help mechanism is that only certain user actions will cause a new 
        context-sensitive help topic to be automatically displayed in an already-open Help view.  For example, changing the focus 
        to a different view in your workspace, switching to a different page in a wizard, or clicking a tab in a descriptor editor will result 
        in fresh information, but other actions, like moving from field to field in a wizard page or descriptor editor, or clicking on items 
        in a graphical editor, do not.</p>
      <p>This limitation is a legacy of the prior context-sensitive help mechanism, the "infopop," which was a temporary pop-up box that 
        displayed the contents of only one context-sensitive help topic and then went away.  To launch an infopop, the user pressed the 
        F1 key; while separate fields in a wizard could have separate helps, the user had to press F1 in each field to access them.  This 
        capability still exists in the Help view â that is, the user can refresh the context-sensitive help topic by pressing F1 from within a 
        different form field, but when the Help view is already open and supposedly dynamic, users shouldn't be expected to have to do 
        that, nor would they likely think to.</p>
      <p>As you have probably deduced, this means that certain UIs could be stuck displaying the same context-sensitive help topic while 
        the user goes about a variety of tasks inside a view or an editor.  How many times will a user read "An X editor is used to edit X 
        files" before deciding that the Help view is neither dynamic nor helpful?  The other extreme--overloading a single help topic for a 
        view or editor with explanations of everything the user might want to know--is not the answer, either.  In that case, the user would 
        recoil from information overload and be annoyed at having to hunt through the text for the desired information.  The better solution 
        is to automatically provide the right information, in the right amount, at the right time.</p>
      <h2>Adding Truly Dynamic Context-Sensitive Help to a Sample Application</h2>
      <p>To achieve our goal of creating truly dynamic context-sensitive help, where the Help view updates with every context change, we 
        need to create our own context provider.  The implementation of a context provider is straightforward and provides two major benefits:
        <ol>
          <li>It addresses the need to have truly context-sensitive help.  In effect, the Help view will have an opportunity to update with every selection 
          change in the workbench.</li>
          <li>You will gain the ability to provide context-sensitive help to a variety of object types beyond those provided by the help system.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>The <code>IWorkbenchHelpSystem.setHelp</code> method (which is limited to the types <code>Control, IAction, 
        Menu and MenuItem</code>) fails to address many of the common editor widget types like TreeItem or GEF objects. The more robust 
        dynamic context-sensitive help that we describe in this section of the article is built upon the default help framework infrastructure using 
        the context ID mapping pattern described in previous section.</p>
      <p>Beyond the setup of the context ID with documentation, two steps are required to create this dynamic help infrastructure.  First, an 
        implementation of <code>IContextProvider</code> must be created for providing an <code>IContext</code> object 
        based on the user selection.  Secondly, the <code>WorkbenchPart</code> (Editor or View) that contains the selection being 
        activated needs to adapt the new context provider based upon the key <code>IContextProvider</code> class.</p>     
      <p>Included with this article is an Eclipse workspace that contains a custom application built on the EMF library example.  
        <a href="ContextSensitiveHelp.zip">Click here</a> to download the ContextSensitiveHelp.zip workspace.  Unzip the ContextSensitiveHelp 
        workspace, and then start Eclipse 3.2, or any product based on Eclipse 3.2, such as Rational Application Developer or 
        Rational Software Architect.</p>  
      <p>The example application provided here extends the original EMF library example (which provides a basic editor for managing library information such as books and writers)
        so that it now  includes dynamic context-sensitive help set up on the library and book objects (steps for adding dynamic context sensitive help for the 
        Writer object are provided later in this article).</p>
      <p>To run the sample application:
        <ol>
        <li><b>Open</b> the ContextsensitiveHelp workspace using any Eclipse version 3.2 environment with EMF.</li>
          <li><b>Open</b> either the Java or Plug-in Development perspectives.</li>
          <li>Select the Library project and click <b>Run &gt; Run As &gt; Eclipse Application.</b> An Eclipse run-time envirnment will start.</li> 
          <li>In the Eclipse run-time environment, click <b>New &gt; Project</b>.  Expand Eclipse Modeling Framework and select <b>Empty EMF Project.</b></li>  
          <li>Give the project a name and click <b>Finish</b>.</li>
          <li>In the Package Explorer, expand the project, right-click on the model folder, and click <b>New &gt; Other.</b></li>  
          <li>Expand Example EMF Model Creation Wizards and select <b>Library Model</b>.</li>  
          <li>Click <b>Next </b>twice.</li>  
          <li>On the Library Model page, select <b>Library</b> from the Model Object list and click <b>Finish.</b>
         The Library Editor opens with your new model (see Figure 4).</li> 
          <li>Press <b>F1</b> and ensure the Help view is open to the Related Topics page.</li>
          <li>Right-click on the <b>Library object</b> in the editor and click <b>New Child &gt; Book.</b></li>
          <li>Give the new book propereties.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

        <img src="images/figure4.jpg" width="554" height="390" alt="The Library Editor"/>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>Notice how clicking on the Book object in the editor provides a different context-sensitive help topic in the Help view than the basic 
        help about the editor (see Figure 5).  If you create a Writer object, note that it does not update the Help view.  This object is not hooked up to a 
        context-sensitive help topic yet; we'll do that manually later in the article.</p>

      <br />  
      <br />
      <p>Back in the ContextSensitiveHelp workspace, examine the sample code and note the following changes we made to the Library Editor to 
        implement dynamic context-sensitive help.</p> 
      <p>We added a basic plugin called "library.csh" with a context.xml file that contains a couple of context-sensitive 
         help topics with IDs like "defaultLibraryId," and we added an extension to <code>org.eclipse.help.contexts</code> to define the contexts.xml, with the 
         plugin set to "library".</p>
      <p>In the library.editor project, we added a plugin dependency to <code>org.eclipse.help</code>.</p>
      <p>In the library.editor project, we created a new class named <code>LibraryHelpContextProvider</code> that 
         implements <code>IContextProvider</code> in the package <code>com.example.library.help</code>.</p>
      <p>We implemented the method <code>getContextChangeMask</code>:</p>
      <p>
            <br /><pre>  
            public int getContextChangeMask() {
               return IContextProvider.SELECTION;
            }</pre><br />
          </p>
      <p>We implemented <code>getContext</code> to return the <code>IContext</code> based upon the EMF selected 
        object:</p>
            <p><br /><pre>  
            public IContext getContext(Object target) {
		ISelection selection = editor.getSelection();
		if (selection instanceof TreeSelection) {
			Object element = ((TreeSelection)selection).getFirstElement();
			if (element instanceof Book) {
				return HelpSystem.getContext("library.libraryBookId");
			}
		}
               return HelpSystem.getContext("library.defaultLibraryId");
            }</pre><br />
          </p>
      <p>We implemented <code>getSearchExpression</code> to return a string that can be used for dynamic help look-up:</p>
            <p><br /><pre>  
            public String getSearchExpression(Object target) {
               return null;
            }</pre><br />
          </p>
      <p>We added a constructor that stores a LibraryEditor as a property:</p>
      <p>
            <br /><pre>  
            public LibraryHelpContextProvider(LibraryEditor editor) {
               this.editor = editor;
            }</pre><br />
          </p>
      <p>We updated the editor to return the declared context provider (the <code>getAdapter</code> method in LibraryEditor in 
          the com.example.library.presentation package):</p>
      <p>
            <br /><pre>  
            	else if (key.equals(IContextProvider.class)) {
                  	if (contextprovider == null)
                  		contextprovider = new LibraryHelpContextProvider(this);
            		return contextprovider;
            	}</pre><br />
          </p>
          <p>We added import statements, as necessary, to resolve errors.</p>
      <p>Finally, we updated the Editor to implement <code>IAdaptable</code> to return our custom provider.</p>
      
      <h3>Adding Dynamic Context Sensitive Help to the Writer object</h3>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, we've left room to add dynamic context-sensitive help to the Writer object.  To do that, follow these steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Add a new context-sensitive help topic to contexts.xml:
            <br /><br /><pre>
            &lt;context id="libraryWriterId" title="Writer"&gt;
              &lt;description&gt;This is context-sensitive help about the writer.
                Without writers there would be no books.&lt;/description&gt;
              &lt;topic href="../library.doc/topics/writers.html"
                label="Writers"/&gt;				
                &lt;/context&gt; </pre><br />
            </li>
          <li>Add a new <code>getContext</code> call to the <code>getContext method</code> in LibraryHelpContextProvider:
            <br /><br /><pre>
            public IContext getContext(Object target) {
                      ISelection selection = editor.getSelection();
                      if (selection instanceof TreeSelection) {
                           Object element =((TreeSelection)selection).getFirstElement();
			       if (element instanceof Book) {
                 		   return HelpSystem.getContext("library.libraryBookId");
			       }
                         if (element instanceof Writer) {
            		   return HelpSystem.getContext("library.libraryWriterId");
                	       }
			    }

      <p>Now, run the sample again and select the Writer object (see Figure 6).  The Dynamic Help view should respond to the selection of the 
        Writer object.</p>

      <h3>Dynamic Search Results</h3>
      <p>Finally, as a bonus, let's direct our attention to the dynamic search results in the Dynamic Help portion 
        of the Help view.  Normally, the search parameters are simply the name of the view or editor and the name 
        of the perspective, which are passed dynamically (and under the covers) to the Help system's search engine.  
        To see for yourself, scroll the Help view to the bottom and click "More results..."  The search parameters used 
        appear in the Search expression text box.</p>
      <p>While it's possible to improve search results by trying to modify help topics to take advantage of the search terms 
        that are already being used, a better solution is to pass more specific search terms.  The new <code>ContextProvider</code> 
        class provides a method called <code>getSearchExpression</code> which allows us to do this.  Since 
        we've gone to the trouble of implementing our own custom context provider, we can use this method.
      </p>
      <p>In the following method in <code>LibraryHelpContextProvider</code>, the search strings that are passed to the search engine are 
        determined by the object selected.  If the book element is selected, the string "library" and "book" are the search parameters.  Otherwise, the 
        default search parameter is "library".</p>
        <p>
        <br /><pre>
	//Here is where dynamic search string values are added
	public String getSearchExpression(Object target) {
		ISelection selection = editor.getSelection();
		if (selection instanceof TreeSelection) {
			Object element = ((TreeSelection)selection).getFirstElement();
			if (element instanceof Book) {
				// return a search string 
				return "\"library\" + \"book\"";
			}
		}
		return "library";
	}</pre><br />
      </p>
      <p>Note that although the search terms are hard-coded into the Java file here, these search expressions can be string-separated for translation purposes, in the same way that any string is externalized.</p>
      <p>As you run the Eclipse application with these changes, remember to click "More results..." at the bottom of the Dynamic Help view so that you 
        can see what search strings are being used.</p>
	<h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Development environments evolve at a very rapid pace.  As soon as a user learns one tool, a new tool arrives and the learing process starts again.  
        As a tool developer, you can help your users by taking advantage of Eclipse's context-sensitive help and Dynamic Assistance framework.  Doing so helps 
        ensure that your users can quickly find information about how to be most effective, which will increase their satisfaction with your tools.</p>
