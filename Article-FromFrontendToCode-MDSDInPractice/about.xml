		Model-driven software development (MDSD) is not just about generating code. Several
		additional challenges have to be mastered. These include: how to get usable graphical and
		textual editors for your domain specific language (DSL), how to validate your models against
		your metamodels, how to define model modifications and transformations and finally, how to
		write scalable, maintainable and extensible code generators. In this article we show how to
		tackle all these challenges, based on a collection of open source tools: Eclipse, Eclipse
		Modeling Framework (EMF), Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) as well as
		openArchitectureWare. We believe that this tool chain provides a proven and stable stack for
		making MDSD a practical reality.
