		Eclipse plug-ins embody an architectural pattern for building an
		application from constituent parts. This article presents an
		in-depth view of the participant roles and collaborations of
		this architectural pattern, as they exist in an instance of the
		Eclipse workbench. The goal is to provide an understanding of
		plug-ins, and of how plug-in extensions are defined and
		processed, independently of the mechanics of using the Eclipse
		workbench to produce plug-ins.
