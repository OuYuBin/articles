<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Summary</B> <BR>
  The traditional Hello World program doesn't do that much, but it can be invaluable 
  when exploring a new development environment. In this article we'll develop 
  the Eclipse Hello World plug-in and show you how to integrate it with the Eclipse 
  Workbench. After you read this article you should know how to use the Eclipse 
  Java&trade; Development Tooling to create, run, and debug a simple plug-in that 
  extends the Eclipse Platform. You'll see how to setup a project for your plug-in, 
  edit the Java code, compile, and run or debug your plug-in in another launched 
  copy of Eclipse. We'll be looking at plug-in manifest files, extensions, and 
  extension points to see how plug-ins are described to Eclipse and how they are 
  integrated with the Platform.

<P>
<HR width="100%">

<P>The Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment (PDE) project provides a very nice 
  environment for creating plug-ins and integrating them with the Eclipse Platform 
  and/or other plug-ins. We're not proposing an alternative to PDE here. PDE is 
  definitely the way to go. But sometimes its helpful to do things "by hand" in 
  order to gain a more thorough understanding of how something works and how the 
  pieces fit together. That's the approach we're going to take in this article. 
  We'll develop a very simple plug-in implementing the Eclipse version of the 
  classic Hello World sample. This will allow us to focus on the relationships 
  between the various components of Eclipse and our plug-in without getting bogged 
  down in the details of the example itself. We'll go raw as much as possible 
  so we can see what's actually happening under the covers. Hopefully this will 
  give you a better understanding of Eclipse, help you make better use of PDE, 
  and give you some idea where to look when things don't go quite as planned.</P>
<H3>The Problem</H3>
<P>For the Eclipse Hello World program, let's start out with a simple design. 
  We're going to add a button to the Workbench toolbar that when pressed, displays 
  an information dialog containing the string "Hello World". Pressing OK dismisses 
  the dialog. Nothing fancy, and certainly not anything that begins to exploit 
  the full extensibility of Eclipse. But something we can easily use to get our 
  feet wet. And it turns out that more complicated examples follow roughly the 
  same pattern so we'll get a lot out of this very simple example.</P>
<P>So lets get started! I'll assume you've already downloaded the latest Eclipse 
  code drop from eclipse.org, have it installed, and know how to start it up. 
  If not, checkout the downloads page at the Eclipse site, and follow the instructions 
  there. </P>
<H3>Step 1: Getting ready to write Java code</H3>
<P>Before we get started, we need to check some workbench preferences to make 
sure its configured properly for plug-in development. We'll be setting other 
properties later in the article, but for now, let's just set the default project
layout and select the JRE we're 
going to use.</P>
<P><B>Setting the default project layout</B>:&nbsp; Edit the Java preferences 
  by selecting the <code>Window-&gt;Preferences</code> menu item.&nbsp; Expand the 
  <code>Java</code> list item.&nbsp; Click on the <code>New Project item</code>&nbsp;
  and check the <code>Folders</code>&nbsp; radio button.
  Ensure &quot;<code>Source folder name</code>&quot; is set to 'src' and 
  that &quot;<code>Output folder name</code>&quot; is set to 'bin'.
  If you do not alter this setting, all of the class files and source files will 
  be placed in directories based at the root of the project.&nbsp; This is fine 
  for small scale development, but is not the structure you want when constructing 
  bigger programs.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Note:&nbsp; The Hello World plug-in assumes that the project layout has been 
  altered to use 'src' and 'bin' folders.&nbsp; If you do not do this, you will 
  get runtime errors when testing your plug-in.</P>
<H3>Step 2: Creating the plug-in Project</H3>
<P>Now we are ready to create a Java project for your plug-in. Go to the Navigator 
  view (Resource Perspective), and select <code>File-&gt;New-&gt;Project</code>.&nbsp; The project creation wizard 
  has a list of categories each with a list of projects.&nbsp; Select the <code>Java</code>&nbsp;
  category in the left hand list and <code>Java project</code>&nbsp; in the right.  Creating a Java 
  project vs. some other project creates a project which understands Java resources 
  and how to manage changes in them. In the Java project wizard, enter a project 
  name for your plug-in. Generally it is a good idea to use the plug-in name or 
  id as the project name to make it easier to deploy your plug-in, and to make 
  sure your plug-in name doesn't collide or get confused with some other plug-in. 
  In our example, we'll use the plug-in id as the project name. Enter <i>org.eclipse.examples.helloworld</i>.</P>
<H3>Step 3: Integrating with Eclipse</H3>
<P>Before we can start writing our code, we need to determine how we're going 
  to integrate with Eclipse. That's because all extensions to Eclipse are done 
  through plug-ins, and plug-ins integrate with each other through extensions 
  on extension points. Eclipse plug-ins typically provide extensions to the platform 
  that support some additional capability or semantics. What is needed is a way 
  for plug-ins to allow other plug-ins to change their behavior in a controlled 
  manner.</P>
<P>Eclipse provides an extensibility mechanism that is scalable, avoids name collisions, 
  doesn't require compilation of the whole product as a unit, and supports multiple 
  versions of the same component at the same time. Eclipse does this by introducing 
  the notion of a plug-in which encapsulates functional extensions to the Platform. 
  Each plug-in has a name, id, provider name, version, a list of other required 
  plug-ins, and a specification for its runtime. A plug-in can also have any number 
  of extension points that provide a portal into which other plug-ins can add 
  their functionality. This is how Eclipse enables other plug-ins to handle the 
  variability supported by your plug-in. In order to integrate with other plug-ins, 
  a plug-in provides extensions on these extension points (perhaps even its own 
  extension points in order to provide some default behavior).</P>
<P>A plug-in is described in an XML file called the plug-in manifest file. This 
file is always called plugin.xml, and is always contained in the plug-in 
sub-directory. The Eclipse Platform reads these manifest files and uses the 
information to populate and/or update a registry of information that is used to 
configure the whole platform. </P>
<P>In our case, we want to use a button on the Workbench toolbar, so the extension 
  point we will use is <code>org.eclipse.ui.actionSets</code>.&nbsp; An action set is a strategy for 
  the addition and removal of menu and toolbar items. This strategy is executed 
  if the user explicitly adds the action set to the workbench. A user can add 
  an action set to the workbench by invoking <code>Window-&gt;Customize Perspective-&gt;Other...</code>&nbsp;
  to display the available actions. To activate an action set, you would navigate 
  the action set categories, select the desired action set, and press OK. A perspective 
  can also add an action set to the initial page layout by invoking <code>IPageLayout.addActionSet(id)</code>.&nbsp; 
  For details on the actionSets extension point, open the help reference material by
  invoking <code>Help-&gt;Help Contents...</code>&nbsp;
  select <code>Platform Plug-in Developer Guide-&gt;Reference-&gt;Extension Points 
  Reference-&gt;Workbench</code>.&nbsp  Select this hyper-link and you will be presented with
  the Platform Extension Points.  You are interested in <code>org.eclipse.ui.actionSets</code>.&nbsp;</P>
<H3>Step 4: Creating the plug-in Manifest File</H3>
<P>Now that we know what we've got to do, lets tell Eclipse about our plug-in 
  by creating the plug-in manifest file. Use <code>File-&gt;New-&gt;Other...</code>&nbsp; 
  and select <code>Simple-&gt;File</code>&nbsp; to create a file called plugin.xml in 
  the org.eclipse.examples.helloworld project. </P>
<P>Edit the plugin.xml file so that it looks like this:</P>
<PRE>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;plugin
	name=&quot;Eclipse Hello World Example&quot;
	id=&quot;org.eclipse.examples.helloworld&quot;
	version=&quot;0.0.0&quot;
	provider-name=&quot;OTI&quot;&gt;
	
    &lt;requires&gt;
	&lt;import plugin=&quot;org.eclipse.core.resources&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;import plugin=&quot;org.eclipse.ui&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/requires&gt;

    &lt;runtime&gt;
	&lt;library name=&quot;helloworld.jar&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/runtime&gt;
	
    &lt;extension point = &quot;org.eclipse.ui.actionSets&quot;&gt;
        &lt;actionSet
            id=&quot;org.eclipse.examples.helloworld.HelloWorldActionSet&quot;
            label=&quot;Hello World&quot;
	    visible=&quot;true&quot;
	    description=&quot;The action set for the Eclipse Hello World example&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;menu
		id=&quot;org.eclipse.examples.helloworld.HelloWorldMenu&quot;
		label=&quot;Samples&quot;&gt;
		&lt;separator name=&quot;samples&quot;/&gt;
	    &lt;/menu&gt;
	    &lt;action id=&quot;org.eclipse.examples.helloworld.actions.HelloWorldAction&quot;
		menubarPath=&quot;org.eclipse.examples.helloworld.HelloWorldMenu/samples&quot;
		toolbarPath=&quot;Normal&quot;			
		label=&quot;Hello World&quot;
		tooltip=&quot;Press to see a message&quot;
		icon=&quot;icons/helloworld.gif&quot;
		class=&quot;org.eclipse.examples.helloworld.HelloWorldAction&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/actionSet&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</PRE>
<P>You can use Eclipse to edit this file using the default text editor. To do 
  so, select <code>Window-&gt;Preferences</code>, expand the Workbench entry, 
  and select <code>File Associations</code>. Add resource extension xml, and add the 
  &quot;Text Editor&quot; to its associations. Now when you attempt to open an editor on a 
  .xml file, you'll do so with the default text editor. This will do just fine 
  for our simple example. PDE makes this a LOT easier for complex plug-ins. </P>
<P>Now lets take a look at the manifest file and see exactly what's there. First 
  we see that we're declaring a <code>plugin</code>. That's always the root element 
  of a plug-in manifest file. The attributes of the <code>plugin</code>&nbsp; element 
  give the plug-in name, id, version, and provider name. The id is the really 
  interesting attribute. It specifies the identifier the platform uses to reference 
  this plug-in. Since this name has to be unique for all installed plug-ins, we 
  use Java package naming conventions to create a unique id. Anything will do, 
  but this is a reasonable convention that should be followed. You'll see how 
  these ids are used a little later when we have to reference another plug-in's 
  extension point.</P>
<P>The <code>requires</code>&nbsp; element is where you specify all the other plug-ins 
  your plug-in depends on. In our case, we're using the actionSets extension of 
  plug-in <code>org.eclipse.ui</code>&nbsp;, so we specify that plug-in here. </P>
<P>The plug-in <code>runtime</code>&nbsp; element is how you tell the platform where 
  to find the classes in your plug-in. Essentially, the <code>requires</code>&nbsp; 
  and the <code>runtime</code>&nbsp; elements go together to specify the "classpath" 
  for the plug-in. This approach allows each plug-in to have its own classpath 
  independent of any other plug-in. Further, each plug-in has its own classloader 
  which is used to load all classes defined by that plug-in (i.e., the classes 
  found in its library declarations).</P>
<P>Now we're finally getting to the real integration! The extension element (in 
  our plugin.xml file) describes an extension on the org.eclipse.ui.actionSets 
  extension point. In our example, we're extending the actionSets extension-point 
  of plug-in <code>org.eclipse.ui</code>.&nbsp; The id of our extension, how the 
  platform refers to it, is <code>org.eclipse.examples.helloworld.HelloWorldActionSet</code>&nbsp; 
  while the display name is &quot;Hello World&quot;. If you look at the documentation 
  referenced above for the actionSets extension-point, you'll see that it can 
  have a number of action elements which describe the actions in the set. Each 
  action has a class attribute that specifies the class that implements the required 
  interface, <code>org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate</code>.&nbsp; 
  This is what we have to implement for our extension. You'll also need to provide 
  the helloworld.gif file to provide an icon for your action. Anything will due 
  for testing. Create the icons folder in your plug-in folder. All plug-in file 
  and folder pathnames are relative to the plug-in folder.</P>
<P>Don't get confused between an extension-point element and an extension element 
  with a point attribute. The extension-point element defines a hook into the 
  platform while the extension specifies and instance of using the hook. The point 
  attribute is the id of the extension-point you're extending. </P>
<H3>Step 5: Setting up the plug-in Project</H3>
<P>Switch to the Java perspective if you're not already there with 
  <code>Window-&gt;Open Perspective-&gt;Other</code>&nbsp; and select the Java 
  perspective (or if Java is available on the menu, you may select it directly). 
  Then select the packages explorer tab to view the packages in your project. You should only 
  see the packages you've specified in your Java build path so far, probably just 
  the JRE_LIB entry for your rt.jar. Since your going to be using the 
  <code>IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate</code>&nbsp; interface, and other parts of 
  the platform to develop our example, you need to include the referenced plug-in 
  runtimes in your Java build path. </P>
<P>From the plug-in manifest file above, we can see that we require plug-in <code>org.eclipse.ui</code>.&nbsp; 
  Referencing the plug-in in the requires element of our plug-in allows the platform 
  to find classes we reference at runtime, but it doesn't help the compiler at 
  development time. We need to get this plug-in's runtime in your project's build 
  path so we can compile against imported classes and interfaces. To do this, 
  select the project and view its properties; right click on the project. Select 
  the <code>Java Build Path</code>&nbsp; entry, and click on the <code>Libraries</code>&nbsp; 
  tab. Then click on the <code>Add External JARs...</code>&nbsp; button and browse 
  to &lt;your eclipse install directory&gt;/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.ui_2.0.0, 
  the directory for the 2.0 version of the Eclipse UI plug-in. </P>
<P>See why we like to have the plug-in ids correspond to the plug-in directory names?   
   It makes it a lot easier to find things. In directory org.eclipse.ui_2.0.0 you'll 
   see the <code>workbench.jar</code>&nbsp; file. Select this file to add it to your 
   build path.
   The Eclipse UI plug-in depends on the Eclipse SWT plug-in, so we will need to add that 
   one too: <code>org.eclipse.swt.win32_2.0.0-&gt;ws-&gt;win32</code>&nbsp; contains 
   <code>swt.jar</code>,&nbsp; assuming you are running on Windows&reg;.  There are 
   similar directories for Linux users running either motif or gtk. 
   The platform automatically provides a special runtime support 
   plug-in: <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime_2.0.0</code>&nbsp; - you should also add the 
   <code>runtime.jar</code>&nbsp; from 
   this plug-in to your build path. If your plug-in depends on any other plug-ins, 
   you'll need to add their jar files too. PDE takes care of all of these things for 
   you, but we'll save that for another article.</P>
<P>Note: Eclipse release 2.1 re-architects the UI plug-in. The <code>workbench.jar</code>&nbsp; 
  is located in the directory <code>org.eclipse.ui.workbench_2.1.0</code>.&nbsp; 
  In addition the JFace plug-in is required. The <code>jface.jar</code>&nbsp; 
  file can be found in the <code>org.eclipse.jface_2.1.0</code>.&nbsp; directory. 
  The remaining plug-ins can be found in the corresponding release 2.1 directories. 
<P>Now we're ready to write the code and compile it against workbench.jar and 
  swt.jar. The workbench has the JDK set, the project has all the jar files in 
  its build path we need, and the plug-in manifest file tells us what classes 
  we have to start with.</P>
<H3>Step 6: Implementing the IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate Interface</H3>
<P>In this example, our implementation of interface <code>IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate</code>&nbsp; 
  is <code>org.eclipse.examples.helloworld.HelloWorldAction</code>. Go take a 
  look at the JavaDoc for the <code>IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate</code>&nbsp; interface to see 
  what methods we need to implement. The JavaDoc is available from the 
  <code>Help-&gt;Help Contents</code>&nbsp; menu item. Select <code>Platform Plug-in Developer Guide</code>&nbsp;
  expand to <code>Reference-&gt;API Reference-&gt;Workbench-&gt;org.eclipse.ui</code>.&nbsp;
  In addition to using standard Java package naming conventions, you should consider 
  including the plug-in id as part of your package name. While not required, it will 
  help you keep your code organized.</P>
<P>To create the implementation class, we'll first create a package for our plug-in. 
  Select the src folder of the <code>org.eclipse.examples.helloworld</code>&nbsp; project in the 
  packages view, right click, and select <code>New-&gt;Package</code>.&nbsp; Create 
  a package named <i>org.eclipse.examples.helloworld</i>.</P>
<P>Next, select the newly created package, right click, and select <code>New-&gt;Class</code>.&nbsp; 
  If you prefer using the tool bar, there are buttons to create a package and 
  a class, among other Java-specific buttons. In the dialog that comes 
  up, verify the package name is <code>org.eclipse.examples.helloworld</code>&nbsp; (it won't be 
  if you didn't select it first), and fill in the class name <i>HelloWorldAction</i> 
  as specified in the class attribute of the action element in our extension (see 
  the manifest file plugin.xml). The superclass <code>java.lang.Object</code>&nbsp; 
  is fine, but add the interface <code>IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate</code>.&nbsp;
  Just click on the <code>Add...</code>&nbsp; button on the right and start typing <i>IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate</i>. 
  You'll see the selection list zero in as you type. Select <code>IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate</code>&nbsp; 
  and click OK. You'll see <code>org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate</code>&nbsp; 
  in the list of interfaces your class is going to implement. For convenience, 
  click on the <code>Inherited abstract methods</code>&nbsp; check box so the new class 
  wizard will create stubs for all the interface methods you need to implement. 
  This will save you a lot of typing. If you don't see the class in the selection 
  list that you expect, this is a good indication that your Java build path isn't 
  including everything it needs. Check your build path in the project preferences 
  and try again.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now we have our <code>IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate</code>&nbsp; implementation 
  class. From the interface we have four methods to implement, <code>init</code>&nbsp; and <code>dispose</code>&nbsp;
  from <code>IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate</code>, and <code>run</code>&nbsp; and <code>selectionChanged</code>&nbsp; 
  from <code>IActionDelegate</code>. Edit the class, and provide the method implementations 
  given below.</P>
<PRE>package org.eclipse.examples.helloworld;


import org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchWindow;
import org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate;
import org.eclipse.jface.action.IAction;
import org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.MessageDialog;
import org.eclipse.jface.viewers.ISelection;
import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Shell;


/** HelloWorldAction is a simple example of using an
 * action set to extend the Eclipse Workbench with a menu 
 * and toolbar action that prints the &quot;Hello World&quot; message.
 */
public class HelloWorldAction implements IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate {
	IWorkbenchWindow activeWindow = null;

	/** Run the action. Display the Hello World message
	 */		
	public void run(IAction proxyAction) {
		// proxyAction has UI information from manifest file (ignored)
		Shell shell = activeWindow.getShell();
		MessageDialog.openInformation(shell, &quot;Hello World&quot;, &quot;Hello World!&quot;);
	}

	// IActionDelegate method
	public void selectionChanged(IAction proxyAction, ISelection selection) {
		// do nothing, action is not dependent on the selection
	}
	
	// IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate method
	public void init(IWorkbenchWindow window) {
		activeWindow = window;
	}
	
	// IWorkbenchWindowActionDelegate method
	public void dispose() {
		//  nothing to do
	}
}
</PRE>
<P>The code isn't too complicated, so I won't cover it in any more detail. Other 
  articles will be addressing the specific Eclipse features we're using, but we 
  want to focus on plug-ins and the end-to-end integration story rather than the 
  code specifics in this article.</P>
<H3>Step 7: Testing your plug-in</H3>
<P>We're ready to test our plug-in! The best way to do this is to use two 
Eclipse workbenches, one for plug-in development, a second for testing and 
debug. Let's call them the development workbench and the testing workbench to 
avoid confusion. We don't want to use the same instance the Eclipse workbench 
for both development and test for a number of reasons:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>You have to restart the workbench every time there's a change in your 
  plug-in so it gets reloaded properly. If you use your development instance for 
  this, you'll be restarting it all the time. 
  <LI>If there's a problem in your plug-in, it could hang the development 
  workbench making it difficult to locate and fix the problem. 
  <LI>You can't debug a workbench with the same workbench that's running the 
  debugger. That's because when the debugger hits a breakpoint, the whole 
  workbench is stopped. </LI></UL>
<P>Prior to launching a testing workbench you must tell Eclipse where the required
  plugins are located.
  Edit the Plug-in Development preferences by selecting the <code>Window-&gt;Preferences</code> 
  menu item.&nbsp;  Expand the <code>Plug-In Development</code> list item.&nbsp;
  Select <code>Target Platform</code> and click on the <code>Not in Workspace</code> button on the
  right hand side.  You will note the selected items in the list to the left of this button are all
  now checked. Finally click on the <code>OK</code> button to accept these changes.
<P>To start Eclipse with Eclipse simply choose <code>Run-&gt;Run As-&gt;Run-time Workbench</code>.&nbsp;
Eclipse automatically starts executing in a second workbench, the testing workbench.
Be patient this operation may appear to take a long time; when a second 
workbench opens the operation is complete.  To view the location of this second workbench browse
the launch configuration via <code>Run-&gt;Run...</code>.&nbsp;  Alternatively
both these functions may be achieved via the Workbench toolbar Run icon.</P>
<P>Now we can test the Hello World actions. You'll 
see the Hello World icon that was specified in the icon attribute of the action 
element in our plug-in manifest file on the Workbench toolbar (if you don't
provide an icon, it will appear as a gray or red square). Move the cursor 
over it and you'll see the hover help you entered. Click and you see the 
message. Not quite as simple as <code>printf("Hello World");</code>&nbsp; but it looks 
a lot nicer.&nbsp; To turn off the Hello World action set (and remove the
associated button), select <code>Window-&gt;Customize Perspective...</code>&nbsp; 
and expand the <code>Other</code>&nbsp;category.&nbsp; Now you can uncheck the 
Hello World item.</P>
<P>When you turn off the Hello World action set, you'll see that the icon is 
removed from the toolbar and you can no longer invoke the plug-in action.</P>
<H3>Debugging your plug-in</H3>
<P>Debugging your plug-in is just as easy. Just open your Java source and put a 
breakpoint where you would like to start debugging. Then debug your test 
workbench by selecting <code>Run-&gt;Debug As-&gt;Run-time Workbench </code>. 
The workbench will open a debug perspective page, 
and you'll see the Eclipse process running. Eclipse will come up, and be ready 
for you to invoke your plug-in. Again, enable the Hello World actions and click 
on the Hello World button. The test workbench will halt at your breakpoint and 
you'll see your code, breakpoint, and variables in the debug perspective in your 
development workbench. Go ahead and experiment with the debugger. Then press 
resume when ready, and up comes the message.  Remember you can only have one
active Run-time workbench, so you will need to close your testing workbench
between trials.</P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<P>We've seen the complete development of a plug-in extension to Eclipse from 
design to debug and test. We've done all the development, testing, and debugging 
using Eclipse itself and the Java Development Tooling. The Hello World example 
doesn't do much, and the complexity per function is pretty high. But more 
complex plug-ins follow the same pattern, and Eclipse provides a lot more than 
we've seen with this simple example. You should now have a pretty good idea how 
all the pieces fit together and what it means to develop and integrate a 
plug-in. Now its time to do something real. You'll want to use PDE for that, so 
look for that article coming soon.</P>
