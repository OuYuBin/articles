PART 2: Managing Operating System Resources</h3></center>

<blockquote><b>Summary</b>
<br>SWT uses operating system resources to deliver its native graphics and widget
functionality. Allocating
and freeing operating system resources is traditionally an area of programming
that is error prone. Languages that include garbage collection, such as the
  Java&trade; language, relieve the programmer from the burden of managing memory, but not
  from the allocation and freeing of operating system resources. This article discusses the simple strategy used by
SWT to help application designers manage operating system resources.

<h3>
Simple rules to help get it right!</h3>
<p>When programming in a GUI operating system, you allocate operating system
resources for widgets, images, fonts, and other graphical objects.&nbsp; Since
there is a platform limit on the amount of resources you can allocate, you must
be careful to free any objects that you allocate in your application.&nbsp; If you
allocate a resource and do not free it when you are done with it, your application is &quot;leaking&quot;
resources. An application that repeatedly leaks resources will
eventually consume all of the available resources, forcing the user to reboot
the operating system.</p>
<p>Fortunately, SWT makes resource allocation and disposal a straightforward
process. There are only two rules that you need to remember when allocating and
freeing SWT resource-based objects:</p>
<p align="center" style="border-style: solid"><b>Rule 1: </b><i>If you created it, you dispose it</i>.<p>This is
a simple rule.&nbsp;SWT makes it easy for you to remember when
operating system resources are allocated: <i>all</i> SWT resource-based objects (like <i>Color</i>,
<i>Cursor</i>,
<i>Display</i>,
<i>Font</i>,
<i>GC</i>,
<i>Image</i>,
<i>Printer</i>,
<i>Region</i>,
<i>Widget
and subclasses</i>) allocate any needed operating system resources in their constructor.&nbsp;
There are no exceptions to this rule.&nbsp; There are no methods in SWT (other
than constructors) that allocate operating system resources that the programmer
must manage. If
you didn't call the constructor, then you don't need to free the resources,
so don't call dispose on the object.&nbsp; For example, in the following
line of code, an operating system font is allocated:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size=-1>Font font = new Font
(display, "Courier",
10, SWT.NORMAL);</font>
<p>Since you called the <i>Font</i> constructor to create the resource,
you must dispose the font when
you are finished with it, as follows:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size=-1>font.dispose();</font>
<p>In the following line of code, however, a constructor is not called:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size=-1>Font font = control.getFont
();</font>
<p>Therefore, you must not call dispose. The <b>font</b> variable does contain
an operating system font resource, but you did not allocate it. If you
were to dispose of this font, you would be leaving the <b>control</b> without
a font!&nbsp; The results are undefined.&nbsp; So, if you are using <i>any</i>
getter that returns an SWT resource-based object that you did not allocate, do not dispose the object.
<p>This rule occasionally leads to API that seems artificial.&nbsp; For
example, <b>GC.getClipping (Region)</b> forces the programmer to create
a <i>Region</i>  in order to get the clipping region from a <i>GC</i>. Although it
might have been a bit "prettier" to provide GC.getClipping () that
returned a <i>Region</i>, this would break the rule because it would have to allocate an operating system
resource outside of a constructor.
While it could be documented that the programmer needs to free the <i>Region</i>
returned by GC.getClipping (), programmers don't always read the documentation.&nbsp;
Making the programmer call the constructor for the <i>Region</i> makes
it clear that it is the <i><u>programmer's</u></i> responsibility to free
the resource.
<p align="center" style="border-style: solid"><b>Rule 2: </b><i>Disposing the parent disposes the children.</i>&nbsp;
<p>
 When you dispose a <i>Shell</i>,
its children are disposed.&nbsp; In fact, disposing any <i>Composite</i>
will dispose all of the <i>Composite</i>'s children.&nbsp; Disposing a
<i>Menu</i>
disposes all menu items.&nbsp; Disposing a <i>Tree</i> or
<i>TreeItem</i>
disposes all child items.
<p>Why does this make sense?&nbsp; Apart from the obvious burden of having
to dispose each child if this were not the case, the fact that a widget
cannot exist in the operating system without a parent implies that when
the parent is disposed, the child <i>must</i> also be disposed.
<p>What about the fonts and colors that you created and set into a
<i>Widget</i>?&nbsp;
Since they are not children of the widget, they are not disposed
when the parent&nbsp; is disposed.&nbsp; A widget will never dispose
a resource that you allocated.&nbsp; To do so would mean that the widget was
breaking rule 1.&nbsp; Because fonts
and colors can be shared by different widgets, disposing a resource in one
widget would dispose it in another, leading to unpredictable results.
<h4>Extensions to Rule 2</h4>
<p>There are two extensions to rule 2. These are places where a relationship
exists that is not strictly a parent-child relationship, but where it still
makes sense for rule 2 to apply.
<p><b> MenuItem.setMenu: </b>Disposing a cascade <i>MenuItem</i>
that has a submenu set with <b>setMenu (Menu)</b> disposes the submenu. This is a natural extension of rule 2.&nbsp; It would be a burden
to the programmer to dispose each individual submenu. It's also common behavior in most operating systems to do this automatically.
Both Windows&reg; and X dispose submenus when a cascade menu item is
disposed.<p><b> Control.setMenu: </b>Disposing a <i>Control</i>
that has a pop-up menu set with <b>setMenu (Menu)</b> disposes the pop-up
menu. Many application programmers expected this behavior, even though many operating systems don't
do this automatically. Leaving the
application programmer responsible for disposing a pop-up menu when disposing the
<i>Control</i>
led to temporary leaks. (The leak was only temporary because the pop-up menu is eventually disposed when
the shell is disposed).
<h3>
Why free at all?</h3>
The operating system frees all of a program's resources when the program
exits. Why not just rely on this? Operating system resources are
not infinite. If your program doesn't free up resources as they are no
longer needed, it can run out of resources. It can also cause other programs
to run out of resources. So waiting until the program exits to free up resources
is generally a bad idea. Leak tools exist to help detect resource leaks.
You can use the <i><a href="sleak.htm">Sleak</a></i> tool to look for leaks in your SWT application.
<h3>
The Java language has Garbage Collection - Why not use it?</h3>
The Java language successfully uses a garbage collector to manage the memory used by
Java objects.&nbsp; Why doesn't SWT use the Java garbage collector to manage
operating system resources too? Many Java programmers ask this question. We will answer it with the following discussion on finalization.<h4><b>Finalization</b></h4>
<p>Most attempts to use the Java garbage collector to
manage operating system resources involve finalization.&nbsp; When an object
is about to become garbage, the garbage collector sends it the finalize message. This seems
like a logical place to free the resource, right?<p>Conventional wisdom says that managing operating system
resources in finalization is difficult and error prone.&nbsp; To quote Joshua
Bloch in his &quot;Java Series&quot; book <i>Effective Java</i>,
<blockquote>
  <p><i>&quot;Finalizers are
unpredictable, often dangerous, and generally unnecessary.&nbsp; Their use can
cause erratic behavior, poor performance, and portability problems.&quot;</i>&nbsp;
[JB, 2.6].
</blockquote>
<p>One of
the main reasons that this statement is true is that there is no guarantee how
soon after an object becomes garbage that the finalize method for the object will run. Even if you could predict
this time interval for a particular VM, you
certainly couldn't guarantee it for new versions of the VM. Worse still, if there
is plenty of memory or if an exception occurs in an object's finalize method, there is no
guarantee that the object will be finalized at all! All of this is stated right in <i>The Java
Language Specification</i>:
<blockquote>
  <p><i>&quot;<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">The
  Java programming language does not specify how soon a finalizer will be
  invoked, except to say that it will happen before the storage for the object
  is reused. ... If an uncaught exception is thrown during the finalization, the
  exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.</span>&quot;</i>&nbsp;
  <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">[JLS,
  12.6]</span>.
</blockquote>
<p>Releasing operating system resources is
critical to correct program execution.&nbsp; Freeing resources at some unknown time in the future (or not at all) typically leads to program
failure. Here are some examples of typical problems encountered when using
finalization:
<ul>
<li>
If a non-garbage object references another object, that object is not garbage
and won't be collected. If the object has operating system resources that it
frees in its finalize method, those resources will never be freed because finalize
will never be called. This is a classic programming error because it's easy to hang on to objects
accidentally in an inner class or a static variable.<br>
</li>

<li>
It is possible to starve other operating system processes by creating lots
of "garbage resources" that have not yet been finalized.&nbsp; When another
program attempts to acquire a resource, it fails because it cannot run
the Java finalizer.&nbsp; SWT could run the finalizer if it couldn't get a resource, but
other programs (i.e. non-Java programs or even Java programs running in a
different VM) - and operating system calls that allocate
and free resources internally - can't run the Java finalizer.<br>
</li>

<li>
Some resources are very limited.&nbsp; For example, only a small number
of cached HDCs are available on Windows 98.&nbsp; It is essential to free
these up right away, instead of waiting for finalization.<br>
</li>

<li>
Different types of resource are shared on the same operating system heap, so a
failure to acquire one resource may be caused by failure to free another.&nbsp;
For example, on Windows 98, HBRUSH and HFONT are both allocated from the
GDI heap, so failure to create an HBRUSH can happen if too many HFONTs are
awaiting finalization. This can cause applications to have some strange
dependencies on the timing of finalizer runs.</li>

</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">The non-deterministic nature of finalization is sufficient reason to avoid using
it to free
resources, but even if we decided to go against conventional wisdom and implement a resource management scheme using finalization, we
would still face many other problems. The implementation would require the addition of some very
complex, platform-specific code that would be difficult to get right, and tough
to debug. Here are a
few examples of some of the tricky issues that would need to be carefully coded
around in each object's finalize method:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Operating system objects can have subtle limitations on when particular objects can be
    disposed. For example in the X Window System, a GC can contain a Font. If you
    dispose the Font before the GC, you leave the operating system in an
    indeterminate state. The following quote from <i>The Java Language
    Specification</i> hints at the complexity of the code that would be required
    to handle such limitations for each object finalizer:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&quot;The Java programming language imposes no
    ordering on finalize method calls. Finalizers may be called in any order, or
    even concurrently.&quot;</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>[JLS
    12.6.2]</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Add to this that for some operating systems, subtle
    platform behavior in this area may be undocumented and can change in future
    versions of the operating system.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal">On some platforms, operating system resources need to be disposed
    in the UI thread. According to <i>The Java Language Specification</i>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><i>&quot;... the language does not specify which
    thread will invoke the finalizer for any given object.&quot;</i> [JLS 12.6]</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="MsoNormal">This means that SWT finalize methods would need to
  synchronize with the UI thread, which would mean that there would be a significant cost overhead for each
  dispose. In addition, given the previous point that disposal order is
  important for some resources, we think it is possible to get into a deadlock
  situation if we are trying to reorder multiple concurrent threads that are
  trying to synchronize with the UI thread.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>

<li>
The Java objects that model operating system objects need to capture all of the subtle
relationships between the operating system objects. For example, on Windows, an HBRUSH
can be referenced in the operating system by an HDC, but not referenced
in Java code.&nbsp; When the Java object representing the HBRUSH becomes garbage,
freeing it will cause unexpected results.&nbsp; In fact, it's necessary
to break the reference from the HDC first before attempting to free the HBRUSH.
If these relationships are not captured and managed, it is possible for a resource to be finalized when there are still references
to it in the operating system.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</li>

<li>
Freeing some resources automatically frees others. For example, on Windows,
destroying a parent HWND automatically destroys the children HWNDs.&nbsp;
On some operating systems, freeing a top level window also frees the icon
associated with the window.&nbsp; Different rules for freeing resources need to be custom coded
on a per platform basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</li>

<li>
Freeing resources can be time
consuming, so a critical memory allocation may need to wait until finalization
is complete.<br>
</li>

<li>
Long waits in finalizers can also make it difficult to get good benchmarks when
you are trying to performance tune your code.</li>

</ul>
<p>Our final point against finalization is this: SWT keeps as much state in the operating system as possible to simplify
the implementation (less code, smaller objects).&nbsp; If we were to use
finalization, we could not store resources only in the operating system.&nbsp; We would have
to hold on to them in Java code so that they would not get garbage collected.&nbsp;
For example, when you set a <i>Font</i> into a <i>Button</i>, SWT sets the font
resource in the OS button.&nbsp; The <i>Button</i> doesn't keep a reference
to the font resource, because it doesn't need to.&nbsp; The state is in
the operating system. In order to determine the <i>Button</i>'s font, we query the OS.&nbsp; There is
no point caching the font resource in Java code, because it just takes up space
and complicates the <i>Button</i> code, which now has to make sure there
are no stale cache problems.</p>
<p>
Given that there are many problems when trying to use finalization to free
resources, we think it’s dangerous to offer it as a solution in SWT, which is
designed to expose operating system functionality.&nbsp; We believe it is reasonable to expect programs to explicitly free operating
system resources.&nbsp; We see this as simply a fact of life because the
current generation of operating systems do not support garbage collection.
<h3>When should you free?</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">You have created an SWT resource, so when do you free it?
First of all, for many of the reasons mentioned above, we do not recommend that you use finalization to manage
your SWT resources either. If you feel you absolutely must implement a finalize
method in your classes, do
so only as a &quot;safety net&quot; or &quot;backup&quot;, and dispose your resource as
usual. Remember to synchronize with the UI thread, as follows:</p>
<font size=-1><p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protected void finalize() {<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// NOT recommended
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>super.finalize();</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>display.asyncExec(new Runnable() {</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>public void run() {</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>if (!myResource.isDisposed()) {</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>myResource.dispose();</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>}</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>}</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>});</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p>
</font>
<p class="MsoNormal">Even this minimal &quot;safety net&quot; use of finalizers is not recommended, because if memory is limited,
your application could end up having to wait for a bunch of your finalize
methods to run before the memory from those
objects can be
reclaimed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The best way to manage SWT resources is to dispose them as
soon as you are through with them. In the case of certain resource types, such as
GC and Printer, you almost always create them and dispose them within the scope of
the same method.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;This makes it easy to
verify that the resource is being disposed properly, because you only have to go
to one place to see the code to create the resource and the code to dispose it. </span>For example:</p>
<font size=-1><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>GC gc = new GC(canvas);</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
gc.draw...&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// do some drawing on the canvas using the GC</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>gc.dispose();</p></font>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the case of resources that are set into a GC for
drawing, you need to be careful not to dispose them while they are still set
into the GC. Dispose the GC before the resource. For example:</p>
<font size=-1><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><font color="#000000">Font font </font> = new Font
(display, "Courier",
10, SWT.NORMAL);</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>GC gc = new GC(canvas);</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
gc.setFont(font);</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
gc.drawText...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// do some text drawing on the canvas using the GC</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>gc.dispose();</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
font.dispose();</p></font>
<p class="MsoNormal">Remember that you do not dispose the GC that is
passed to you in a paint listener, because you did not allocate it!</p>
<font size=-1><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>public void paintControl(PaintEvent event) {</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span> event.gc.draw...</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="mso-tab-count: 1"> // do NOT call event.</span>gc.dispose();</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
}</p></font>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you are using graphics resources in a widget - for example,
widget.setFont(font) - it is often best to clean these up when the
widget they are used in is disposed, so you can hook a dispose listener on the
widget as follows:</p>
<font size=-1><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>widget.addDisposeListener(new DisposeListener() {</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>public void widgetDisposed(DisposeEvent e) {</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>font.dispose();</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>}</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>}</p></font>
<p class="MsoNormal">If resources are shared by multiple widgets (or other
objects) in your application, then you may want to implement a
reference-counting scheme in a &quot;resource manager&quot; class, which would
keep track of the number of references to a resource, and dispose the resource
when the reference count reaches 0.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
this case, you would ask your resource manager for each resource you need,
perhaps something like this:</p>
<font size=-1><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Image image = myResourceManager.getNamedResource(&quot;imageName&quot;);</p>
</font>
<p class="MsoNormal">and the dispose listener on your widget(s) might look
something like this:</p>
<font size=-1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>widget.addDisposeListener(new DisposeListener() {</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Whether or not to use a reference-counting scheme, and how
to implement it, are design decisions that must be made on a per-application

<p class="MsoNormal">Widgets themselves do not usually need to be disposed
programmatically. A shell and its children are disposed when the user closes its
window. There are a couple of places where shells are typically disposed programmatically: when the user
selects File-&gt;Exit in an application window, or OK in a dialog. Here is an
example of disposing a shell when File-&gt;Exit is selected:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Note that we actually call <b>close()</b> instead of <b>dispose()</b>.
This gives the application a chance to cancel the close operation if necessary
(for example, if something was not saved) inside of a shell listener. We could
call <b>dispose()</b>, which would simply destroy the shell without invoking the
shell listener, but it's better style to call <b>close()</b>.</p>
<h3>
A note about Color</h3>
<i>Color</i> is just like any other SWT resource-based object. To ensure
that your application works on all platforms for all display types, always
follow rule 1. If you are using a high-color (direct palette) display and you forget to follow
the rules for disposing <i>Color</i>, you may notice that nothing bad happens.
But if the rules for disposing <i>Color</i>
are not followed on a low-color (indexed palette) display, real problems can occur. You
should always program your application with the assumption that some of
your customers will be using low-color displays. For more information,
see the <i>SWT Color Model</i> article.
<h3>
Conclusion</h3>
When you use SWT, you will probably need to manage operating system resources
allocated by SWT objects. Resource management
takes thought to get right. Getting into good habits and following the rules
reduces the programming effort significantly. Simple rules help make
it clear who has responsibility for disposing resources:
<ul>
<li>
<i>If you created it, you dispose it</i> (<i>if you didn't create it, don't dispose it)</i>.</li>

<li>
<i>Disposing the parent disposes the children.</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>Further reading</h3>
<p>JFace provides a registry mechanism on top of SWT
for image and font resource management. See the article <i>Using Images
in the Eclipse UI</i> for more information on the JFace image management
facilities.</p>
