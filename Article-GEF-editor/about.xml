		GEF is a very powerful framework for visually creating and
		editing models. With a small initial investment, even the
		relative Eclipse novice can be quickly up and running, building
		applications with graphical editing capabilities. To illustrate,
		this article uses a relational database schema diagram editor
		with a deliberately simplified underlying model, but with enough
		bells and whistles to show some of the interesting features of
		GEF at work.
