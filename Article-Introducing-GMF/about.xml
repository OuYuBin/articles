		Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) is a new Eclipse project with
		the potential to become a keystone framework for the rapid
		development of standardized Eclipse graphical modeling editors.
		GMF is divided in two main components: the runtime, and the
		tooling used to generate editors capable of leveraging the
		runtime. Architects and developers involved in the development
		of graphical editors or of plug-ins integrating both EMF and GEF
		technologies should consider building their editors against the
		GMF Runtime component. This article is designed to help
		understand the benefits of the GMF Runtime by presenting its
		various value-added features.
