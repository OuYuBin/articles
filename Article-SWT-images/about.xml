		SWT's Image class can be used to display images in a GUI. The
		most common source of images is to load from a standard file
		format such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, or BMP. Some controls, including
		Buttons and TreeItems, are able to display an Image directly
		through the setImage(Image) method, but any control's paint
		event allows images to be drawn through the callback's graphic
		context. SWT's ImageData class represents the raw data making up
		an SWT Image and determines the color for each pixel coordinate.
		This article shows the correct uses of ImageData and Image,
		shows how to load images from files, and how to achieve graphic
		effects such as transparency, alpha blending, animation,
		scaling, and custom cursors.
