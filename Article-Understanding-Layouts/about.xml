		When writing applications in SWT, you may need to use layouts to
		give your windows a specific look. A layout controls the
		position and size of children in a Composite. Layout classes are
		subclasses of the abstract class Layout. This article shows you
		how to work with standard layouts, and write your own custom
		layout class.
