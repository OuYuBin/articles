The process of updating the landing page for articles has been completely
automated. To make use of this, you must provide a file, about.xml, for 
each article. It is assumed that each article exists in a subdirectory of
the "articles" directory. The about.xml file contains all the metadata for 
one article and includes a link (relative to the location of about.xml).

Future plans:

Update this document to describe the format of the about.xml file.
Build a schema for the about.xml file.

Improve support for update metadata. Currently, only a date is captured. 
I'd like to capture the identity of the updater as well.
