<h1 align="center">DRAFT: How to Correctly and Uniformly Use Progress Monitors</h1>



<blockquote>
  <b>Summary</b>

  <br>

Handling a progress monitor instance is deceptively simple. It seems to
be straightforward but it is easy to make a mistake when using them.
And, depending on numerous factors such as the underlying
implementation, how it is displayed, if it&rsquo;s set to use a fixed
number of work items or &lsquo;unknown&rsquo;, if used through a <span style="font-style: italic;">SubProgressMonitor</span> wrapper etc., the result can range from completely ok, mildly confusing or outright silliness. <br>

  <br>

In this article I hope I can lay down a few ground rules that will help
anyone use progress monitors in a way that will work with the explicit
and implicit contract of <span style="font-style: italic;">IProgressMonitor</span>. Also, understanding the usage side makes it easier to understand how to implement a monitor.<br>

<h2>Using a progress monitor - what's up with that?</h2>

It all really comes down to a few, not too complex, rules. A common
theme is 'know what you know - but only that'. This means that you
shouldn't assume you know things you really don't know, and this
includes the common mistake of only considering progress monitors you
have seen, i.e. typically the graphical ones when using the IDE.
Another thing to watch out for is the fact that commonly you design a
number of tasks that may call each other using sub progress monitors,
and while doing that make assumptions based on your knowledge that they
will be called in this manner - never forget that sometime maybe your
separate subtasks may be called from not-yet-written routines. It's
then vitally important that your subtasks act exactly in a 'neutral'
manner, i.e. with no 'implicit assumptions' on what happened before or
what will happen after.<br>

<br>

One of the motivations for this article is when I tried my hand at
implementing a progress monitor intended for headless/console use - and
realised that code using it could make it look really wacky when the
monitor was wrongly used, and this was issues that were not as readily
apparent with a graphical monitor. Also, code (including my own)
frequently abuses the explicit and implicit (which admittedly are my
interpretation of reasonable behavior) contract that the
IProgressMonitor interface states, and this makes for dicey decisions
for a monitor implementor - should it complain (and how) when it gets
conflicting orders? If not, how should it then behave to make for a
reasonable and intuitive user experience?<br>

<br>

<!-- Anyway, since an article of this type would have helped me immensely
when I started working in the Eclipse environment, I figured I should
try my hand at summing up my view of how the interaction with <span style="font-style: italic;">IProgressMonitor</span> should work.<br>-->

<h3>The protocol of <span style="font-style: italic;">IProgressMonitor</span></h3>

Generally, all interaction with a progress monitor is through the interface <span style="font-style: italic;">IProgressMonitor</span>
and this interface defines the protocol behavior expected. It does
leave some things up in the air though; for example, the description
states some things that should be true, but the methods have no <span style="font-style: italic;">throws</span>
clause that helps enforce some invariants. I have chosen to interpret
the descriptions &lsquo;hard&rsquo;, even to the point of saying
it&rsquo;s valid to throw an (unchecked) exception if a described rule
is violated (this is somewhat controversial of course - if you
implement a monitor doing this you should probably provide a way to
turn off 'strictness'). Hopefully we could eventually see a new
interface that deprecates the old methods and provides new ones that
better reflect the contract. The discussion below is based on the
assumption that the reader is familiar with the general API; review it
in the Eclipse help.<br>

<br>

The first important consideration is the realization that a monitor
(contract wise) can be in basically four states. Any given
implementation may or may not track those state changes and may or may
not do anything about them, which is part of the reason that
misbehaving users of a monitor sometimes gets away with it. Only one of
these states are readily testable using the interface however (if the
monitor is canceled); the other states are just a given from correct
use of the interface.<br>

<br>

Essentially, the state changes are governed by the methods <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">done()</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">setCanceled()</span>,
plus the implicit initial state of a new instance. Note that for the
purposes discussed here the perceived &lsquo;changes in state&rsquo;
occurring as a result from calling <span style="font-style: italic;">worked()</span> is not relevant. A separate discussion below details how to deal with <span style="font-style: italic;">worked()</span> calls.<br>

<br>

NB: The states described here are not any &lsquo;officialese&rsquo;
that can be found as constants or anything like that; they&rsquo;re
only here to serve so they can be used for discussion.<br>

<br>

<ul>

  <li>PRISTINE<br>

This is the initial state of a newly created instance of an <span style="font-style: italic;">IProgressMonitor</span> implementation, i.e. before <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span>
has been called. In principle a given implementation may handle a
single instance such that it is reusable and reverted back to the
PRISTINE state after a done() call, but that is opaque from the point
of the contract. In this state it should be essentially correct and
possible to go to any of the other states, but the typical and expected
transition should be from PRISTINE to IN_USE as a result from a
successful beginTask() call. The transition to FINISHED should result
only in a very particular situation, see more below.</li>

  <li>IN_USE<br>

This is the state the monitor after the first and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> call to <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span>. This is one of those things that are very easy to get wrong; contract wise, <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span>
can and should only be called at most once for a given instance. A more
detailed discussion on the code pattern required to deal with this
obligation can be found below.</li>

  <li>FINISHED<br>

The transition to this state is achieved by calling <span style="font-style: italic;">done()</span>. As with <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">done()</span> should only be called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">once</span> and should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span> be called on a monitor when <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span> has been called (i.e. it is ok to not call <span style="font-style: italic;">done()</span>
only if the monitor is still in the PRISTINE state). Again, the
discussion below is more detailed on how to ensure proper protocol.</li>

  <li>CANCELED<br>

Actually, this state is slightly murky; it&rsquo;s possible that
canceled/not canceled should be tracked separately from the others.
But, contract wise it should be adequate if this state is either
achieved directly from PRISTINE and just left that way, or if <span style="font-style: italic;">done()</span> is called (likely as a result of detecting the canceled status), it is cleared and the monitor then transitions to FINISHED.</li>

</ul>

<br>

Now, one contract pattern described above is that if <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span> is ever called, <span style="font-style: italic;">done()</span> MUST be called. This is achieved by always following this code pattern (all code is simplified):<br>

<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">monitor = &hellip; // somehow get a new progress monitor which is in a pristine state<br>// figure some things out such as number of items to process etc&hellip;<br>try<br>	{<br>	monitor.beginTask(&hellip;)<br>	// do stuff and call worked() for each item worked on, and check for cancellation<br>	}<br>finally<br>	{<br>	monitor.done()<br>	}	<br></pre>

The important thing here then is to ensure that <span style="font-style: italic;">done()</span> is always called (by virtue of being in the <span style="font-style: italic;">finally</span> clause) but (normally) only if <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span> has been successfully called (by virtue of being the first thing called in the <span style="font-style: italic;">try</span> clause). There is a small loophole that could cause <span style="font-style: italic;">done()</span>
to be called without the monitor actually transitioning from PRISTINE
to IN_USE. This loophole can&nbsp;with this pattern only happen if a
particular <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span> implementation throws an unchecked exception (The interface itself declares no <span style="font-style: italic;">throws</span>
clause) before it internally makes a note of the state change (if the
specific implementation even tracks state in this manner and/or is too
loose in its treatment of the interface contract).<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 62px; height: 13px;" alt="tip" src="images/note.gif"> Arguably, you should <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">always</span> strive for calling <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span>/<span style="font-style: italic;">done()</span>.
The reasons for this are buried in the fact that you in principle never
know when you are being called as a subtask. If you don't 'complete'
the monitor, the parent can end up with an incorrect count for its own
task. The full rationale is covered more below, in the section <a href="#Ensure_to_always_complete_your_monitor">"Ensure to always complete your monitor!"</a>.<br>

<h3>Delegating use of a progress monitor to subtasks</h3>

Above for the IN_USE state I mentioned that it&rsquo;s very easy to get things wrong; <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span>
should never be called more than once. This frequently happens in code
that doesn&rsquo;t correctly understand the implications of the
contract. Specifically, such code pass on the same instance it has been
given to subtasks, and those subtasks; not aware that the caller
already has begun following the contract, also tries following the
contract in the expected manner &ndash; i.e. they start by doing a <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span>.<br>

<br>

Thus, passing on a monitor instance is almost always wrong unless the
code knows exactly what the implications are. So the rule becomes: In
the general case, a piece of code that has received a progress monitor
from a caller should always assume that the instance they are given is
theirs and thus completely follow the <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span>/<span style="font-style: italic;">done()</span>
protocol, and if it has subtasks that also needs a progress monitor,
they should be given their own monitor instances through further use of
the <span style="font-style: italic;">SubProgressMonitor</span> implementation that wraps the &lsquo;top-level&rsquo; monitor and correctly passes on <span style="font-style: italic;">worked()</span> calls etc (more on this below).<br>

<br>

Sample code to illustrate this:<br>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<pre>monitor = &hellip; // somehow get a new progress monitor which is in a pristine state<br>// figure some things out such as number of items to process etc&hellip;<br>try<br>	{<br>	monitor.beginTask(&hellip;)<br>	// do stuff and call worked() for each item processed, and check for cancellation<br>	&hellip;<br>	// farm out a piece of the work that is logically done by &lsquo;me&rsquo; to something else<br>	someThing.doWork(new SubProgressMonitor(monitor,&hellip;))<br>	// farm out another piece of the work that is logically done by &lsquo;me&rsquo; to something else<br>	anotherThing.doWork(new SubProgressMonitor(monitor,&hellip;))<br>	}<br>finally<br>	{<br>	monitor.done()<br>	}<br></pre>

</div>

Note that each <span style="font-style: italic;">doWork()</span> call gets a new instance of a <span style="font-style: italic;">SubProgressMonitor</span>; such instances can and should not be reused for all the protocol reasons already discussed.<br>

<br>

The only time a single instance of a monitor passed to, or retrieved
by, a certain piece code can be reused in multiple places (e.g.
typically methods called by the original receiver), is when the code in
such methods is so intimately coupled so that they in effect
constitute a single <span style="font-style: italic;">try</span>/<span style="font-style: italic;">finally</span> block. Also, for this to work each method must know exactly who does <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span>/<span style="font-style: italic;">done()</span> calls, and also (don&rsquo;t forget this) how many work items they represent of the total reported to <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span>
so that they can make the correct reports. Personally, I believe this
is generally more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth &ndash; always follow
the regular pattern of one receiver, one unique monitor instead and the
code as a whole is more maintainable.<br>

<h3>Managing the item count</h3>

This section is about how to do the initial <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span> call and report the amount of total work expected, and then ideally report <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exactly</span>
that many items to the monitor. It is ok to end up not reporting all
items in one particular case: when the job is aborted (due to
cancellation by user, an exception thrown and so on) &ndash; this is
normal and expected behavior and we will wind up in the <span style="font-style: italic;">finally</span> clause where <span style="font-style: italic;">done()</span> is called.<br>

<br>

It is however sloppy technique to &lsquo;just pick a number&rsquo; for the total and then call <span style="font-style: italic;">worked()</span>,
reporting a number and hope that the total is never exceeded. Either
way this can cause very erratic behavior of the absolute top level and
user visible progress bar (it is for a human we&rsquo;re doing this
after all) &ndash; if the total is too big compared to the actual items
reported, a progress bar will move slowly, perhaps not at all due to
scaling and then suddenly (at the <span style="font-style: italic;">done()</span>
call) jump directly to completed. If the total is too small, the bar
will quickly reach &rsquo;100%&rsquo; or very close to it and then stay
there &lsquo;forever&rsquo;. <br>

<br>

So, first and foremost: do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span>
guess on the number of work items. It&rsquo;s a simple binary answer:
either you know exactly how many things that will be
processed&hellip;or you don&rsquo;t know. It IS ok to not know! If you
don't know, just report&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">IProgressMonitor.UNKNOWN</span> as the total number, call <span style="font-style: italic;">worked()</span>
to your hearts content and a clever progress monitor implementation
will still do something useful with it. Note that each (sub)task can
and should make its own decision on what it knows or not. If all are
following the protocol it will ensure proper behavior at the outer,
human visible end. A heads up though: never call the <span style="font-style: italic;">SubProgressMonitor(parentMonitor, subticks)</span> constructor using&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">IProgressMonitor.UNKNOWN</span> for subticks - this is wrong! More on this later.<br>

<h3>How to call <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">worked()</span></h3>

There are typically two basic patterns where you know how many items
you want to process: either you are going to call several different
methods to achieve the full result, or you are going to call one method
for each instance in a collection of some sort. Either way you know the
total item count to process (the number of methods or the size of the
collection). Variations of this are obviously combinations of these
basic patterns&nbsp;so just multiply and sum it all up.<br>

<br>

There is sometimes a benefit of scaling your total a bit. So, instead of reporting &lsquo;3&rsquo; as the total (and do <span style="font-style: italic;">worked(1)</span> for each item) you may consider scaling with, say 1000, and reporting &lsquo;3000&rsquo; instead (and do <span style="font-style: italic;">worked(1000)</span>
for each item). The benefit comes up when you are farming out work to
subtasks through a SubProgressMonitor; since they may internally have a
very different total, especially one that is much bigger than your
total, you give them (and the monitor instance) some &lsquo;room&rsquo;
to more smoothly consume and display the allotment you&rsquo;ve given
them (more explanations below on how to mix <span style="font-style: italic;">worked()</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">SubProgressMonitor</span>
work below). Consider that you say &lsquo;my total is 3&rsquo; and you
then give a subtask &lsquo;1&rsquo; of these to consume. If the subtask
now will report several thousand <span style="font-style: italic;">worked()</span>
calls, and assuming that the actual human visible progress bar also has
the room, the internal protocol between a SubProgressMonitor and
it&rsquo;s wrapped monitor will scale better and give more smooth
movement if you instead would have given it &lsquo;1000&rsquo; out of
&lsquo;3000&rsquo;. Or not - the point is really that you don't know
what monitor implementation will be active, all you can do is give some
information. How it's then displayed in reality is a matter of how
nifty the progress monitor implementation is.<br>

<br>

A sample of simple calls:<br>

<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">monitor = &hellip; // somehow get a new progress monitor which is in a pristine state<br>int total = 3 // hardcoded and known<br>try<br>	{<br>	monitor.beginTask(total)<br>	<br>	// item 1<br>	this.doPart1()<br>	monitor.worked(1)<br><br>	// item 2<br>	this.doPart2()<br>	monitor.worked(1)<br><br>	// item 3<br>	this.doPart3()<br>	monitor.worked(1)<br>	}<br>finally<br>	{<br>	monitor.done()<br>	}</pre>

No reason to scale and no collection to dynamically compute.<br>

<br>

A more elaborate sample:<br>

<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">monitor = &hellip; // somehow get a new progress monitor which is in a pristine state<br>int total = thingyList.size() * 3 + 2<br>try<br>	{<br>	monitor.beginTask(total)<br>	<br>	// item 1<br>	this.doBeforeAllThingies()<br>	monitor.worked(1)<br>		<br>	// items 2 to total-1<br>	for (Thingy t : thingyList)<br>		{<br>		t.doThisFirst()<br>		monitor.worked(1)<br>		t.thenDoThat()<br>		monitor.worked(1)<br>		t.lastlyDoThis()<br>		monitor.worked(1)<br>		}<br><br>	// final item <br>	this.doAfterAllThingies()<br>	monitor.worked(1)<br>	}<br>finally<br>	{<br>	monitor.done()<br>	}<br></pre>

<h3>Mixing straightforward calls with subtasks</h3>

I was initially confused by how to report progress when I farmed out
work to subtasks. I experienced &lsquo;reporting too much work&rsquo;
since I didn&rsquo;t understand when to call and when to not call <span style="font-style: italic;">worked()</span>. Once I caught on, the rule is very simple however: calling a subtask with a <span style="font-style: italic;">SubProgressMonitor</span> is basically an implicit call to <span style="font-style: italic;">worked()</span> with the amount allotted to the subtask. So instead of this:<br>

<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">monitor = &hellip; // somehow get a new progress monitor which is in a pristine state<br>int scale = 1000<br>int total = 3 // hardcoded and known<br>try<br>	{<br>	monitor.beginTask(total * scale)<br>	<br>	// item 1<br>	this.doPart1()<br>	monitor.worked(1 * scale)<br><br>	// item 2<br>	this.doPart2(new SubProgressMonitor(monitor, 1 * scale)) // allot 1 item<br>	monitor.worked(1 * scale) // WRONG! Not needed, already managed by the SubProgressMonitor<br><br>	// item 3<br>	this.doPart3()<br>	monitor.worked(1 * scale)<br>	}<br>finally<br>	{<br>	monitor.done()<br>	}</pre>

You should just leave out the second call to <span style="font-style: italic;">worked()</span>.<br>

<h4><img style="width: 62px; height: 13px;" alt="Tip" src="images/note.gif"> Never pass <span style="font-style: italic;">IProgressMonitor.UNKNOWN</span> (or any other <span style="text-decoration: underline;">negative</span> value) when creating a <span style="font-style: italic;">SubProgressMonitor()</span> wrapper!</h4>

A
situation I just the other day experienced was when doing an <span style="font-style: italic;">IProgressMonitor.UNKNOWN</span>
number of&nbsp;things - I needed to call a subtask, and hence I set up to
call it using a <span style="font-style: italic;">SubProgressMonitor(parent, subticks)</span> but
I realized that I hadn't ever considered how the sub monitor should be
created - how many subticks it should be given - in the unknown case. I
figured it should be ok to pass&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">IProgressMonitor.UNKNOWN</span> there also. However, when
later trying my code I saw to my horror that my progress bar went
backwards! Not the effect I figured on...<br>

<br>

As it turns out, this is because the implementation (as of Eclipse
3.2M3) blindly uses the incoming ticks as a scaling factor. However, it
goes haywire when it receives a negative value (and <span style="font-style: italic;">IProgressMonitor.UNKNOWN</span> happens to have a value of -1). It does computations with it, and it ends up calling <span style="font-style: italic;">worked()</span>
with negative values which my monitor tried to process...that code is
now fixed to be more resilient in such cases. I've filed <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=119018">bug #119018</a> to
request that <span style="font-style: italic;">SubProgressMonitor</span> handles it better and/or document that negative values is a bad idea for the constructor call.<br>

<br>

Whatever, passing&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">IProgressMonitor.UNKNOWN</span> is incorrect in any case. If you have called <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span> using&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">IProgressMonitor.UNKNOWN</span> you can gladly pass in any reasonable tick value to a <span style="font-style: italic;">SubProgressMonitor</span>, it will give the correct result.<br>
<h3><a name="Ensure_to_always_complete_your_monitor"></a>Ensure to always complete your monitor!</h3>
Consider the concept described in the previous section: the important
thing here is that basically, you say that you have three distinct and
logical things to do, and then you tick them off - but one of the ticks
is actually farmed out to a subtask through a <span style="font-style: italic;">SubProgressMonitor</span>. You don't really know how many distinct and logical things the subtask has to do, nor should you care. The mechanics of using a <span style="font-style: italic;">SubProgressMonitor</span> makes the advancement of one of&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">your</span>
ticks happen in the correct way. So, the end&nbsp;expectation is that
once you reach the end of your three things, the monitor you have, have
actually fulfilled the count you intended - the internal state of it
should reflect this: &quot;the user said three things should happen and my
work count is now indeed '3'&quot;.<br>
<br>
But, as I recently found out, this can fail. Specifically, I blindly invoked <span style="font-style: italic;">IProject.build()</span> on a project which had no builders configured. To this method I sent in a <span style="font-style: italic;">SubProgressMonitor</span>
and allotted it one 'tick' of mine. But, as it turned out, internally
it never used the monitor it got, presumably because there was no work
to perform - not very unreasonable in a sense. However, this did have
the effect that one of my ticks never got, well, 'tocked' :-). I could
solve this specific problem by simply checking if there was any
builders configured, and if there were none, I simply advanced the tick
by&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">worked(1)</span> instead. But, it requires me, the caller, to make assumptions on the internal workings of the subtask, which is never good.<br>
<br>
This is not a huge problem of course. But, I think it would make sense to always act the same. The code resulting from <span style="font-style: italic;">IProject.build()</span> could just call <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask(&quot;&quot;, countOfBuilders)</span> regardless of if countOfBuilders was 0, iterate over the empty array or whatever, and then call <span style="font-style: italic;">done()</span>. This would correctly advance <span style="font-weight: bold;">my</span> tick.
<h3>Cancellation</h3>

The sample code above does not show cancellation checks. However, it
is obviously recommended that users of a progress monitor actively
check for cancellation to timely break out of the operation. The more
(potentially) long-running, the more important of course. And remember:
you don't know if the operation is running in a context that allows it
to be canceled or not - so you just have to code defensively. A sample
of how it should look could be this:<br>

<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">monitor = &hellip; // somehow get a new progress monitor which is in a pristine state<br>try<br>	{<br>	monitor.beginTask(thingyList.size())<br>	<br>	for (Thingy t : thingyList)<br>		{<br>		if(monitor.isCanceled())<br>			throw new OperationCanceledException();<br>		t.doSomething()<br>		monitor.worked(1)		<br>		}<br>	}<br>finally<br>	{<br>	monitor.done()<br>}<br></pre>

<h3>The <span style="font-style: italic;">NullProgressMonitor</span></h3>

A common pattern is to allow callers to skip sending a monitor, i.e. sending &lsquo;<span style="font-style: italic;">null</span>&rsquo;. A simple and convenient way to deal with such calls is this:<br>

<pre style="margin-left: 40px;">public void doIt(IProgressMonitor monitor)<br>{<br>	// ensure there is a monitor of some sort<br>	if(monitor == null)<br>		monitor = new NullProgressMonitor();<br><br>	try<br>	{<br>		monitor.beginTask(thingyList.size())<br>	<br>		for (Thingy t : thingyList)<br>			{<br>			if(monitor.isCanceled())<br>				throw new OperationCanceledException();<br>			t.doSomething()<br>			monitor.worked(1)		<br>			}<br>	}<br>finally<br>	{<br>		monitor.done()<br>	}	<br>}<br></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

I believe that by diligently following these rules and patterns, you
will never have a problem in using the progress monitor mechanism.
Obviously, it requires implementations to follow the contract as well.
But remember, if you mistreat the protocol you will sooner or later end
up talking to a progress monitor implementation that is stern and will
simply throw an exception or give strange visual effects if you call
it&rsquo;s <span style="font-style: italic;">beginTask()</span> one time too many. It&rsquo;s essentially valid if the <span style="font-style: italic;">IProgressMonitor</span> interface description is to be believed &ndash; and you will get blamed by your customer&hellip;
